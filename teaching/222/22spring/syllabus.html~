  <b>Meeting Times and Place</b><br /> MTuWThF 9:00 - 9:53 AM, MOLN
  D128.
</p>

<p>

  placement.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Textbook</b><br /> Stewart, <i>Calculus</i>, 8th edition (2012),
  Cengage.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Introductory differential and
  integral calculus and applications. Topics include rate of change
  and limits, continuity, differentiation, applications of the
  derivative, integration, applications of the integral, and
  transcendental functions. We will cover most of chapters 1 - 6 from
  the textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned in class; most
  will be taken from the textbook. You may discuss homework problems
  with other students, but I recommend that you first try to solve
  them on your own.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, three
  in-class exams, and periodic quizzes. The final exam will be on
  Wednesday May 11, 8:00 - 10:00 AM. Each of the in-class exams will
  be announced in class at least one week before it is given.The final
  grade will be calculated using the following weights: quizzes 20%;
  in-class exams 20% each; final exam 20%. Your lowest two quiz scores
  will be dropped. The following grading scale will be applied: 90 -
  100 A, 80 - 89 B, 70 - 79 C, 60 - 69 D, 0 - 59 F.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> In-class exams may be made up in the event
  of documented illness.  If you miss an exam, you need to inform me
  before the time of the exam. Exams must be made up within one day of
  the original exam date. There are no makeup quizzes.
</p>

<p>
  <b> Studying</b><br /> A general rule for this course is for
  every 1 hour spent in a class you should spend 1 to 3 hours
  outside of class studying.  If it is a difficult class for
  you, you may need to spend more time than this.  In math
  people often think: I did the homework; that's all the
  studying I need to do.  Reading your notes and reviewing your
  homework, quizzes, and exams are also excellent ways to help
  you succeed in this course.
</p>

<p><b>Calculators</b><br /> Calculators are not allowed on exams or
  quizzes and not required for the course.
