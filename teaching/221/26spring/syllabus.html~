  <b>Meeting Times and Place</b><br /> MTWThF 8:00 - 8:53 AM, MOLN
  L167.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Prerequisites</b><br /> Math 111 with a grade of C or better; or
  equivalent; or appropriate placement.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Required Textbook</b><br /> Stewart, <i>Precalculus: Mathematics
  for Calculus</i>, seventh edition.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Covers functions and graphs,
  polynomials and rational functions, exponential and logarithmic
  functions, trigonometric functions, trigonometric identities and
  equations, applications, sequences, series.  We will cover parts of
  chapters 1 - 7, 10, and 12 from the textbook. </p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned almost every
  day. You may discuss homework problems with other students, but I
  recommend that you first try to solve them on your own.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, four
  in-class exams, and weekly quizzes. The dates of the in-class exams
  will be announced at least one week in advance of the exams.  Your
  two lowest quiz scores will be dropped.  The final grade will be
  calculated using the following weights: quizzes 16%; in-class exams
  16% each; final exam 20%.  The following grading scale will be
  applied: 92 - 100 A, 90 - 91 A-, 88 - 89 B+, 82 - 87 B, 80 - 81 B-,
  78 - 79 C+, 72 - 77 C, 70 - 71 C-, 62 - 69 D, 60 - 61 D-, 0 - 59 F.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> In-class exams may be made up in the
  event of documented illness.  If you miss an exam, you need to
  inform me before the time of the exam. Exams must be made up
  within one day of the original exam date. There are no makeup
  quizzes.</p>

<p>
  <b> Studying</b><br /> A general rule for this course is for every 1
  hour spent in a class you should spend 1 to 3 hours outside of class
  studying.  If it is a difficult class for you, you may need to spend
  more time than this.  Reading your notes and reviewing your
  homework, quizzes, and exams are also excellent ways to help you
  succeed in this course.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Calculators</b><br /> Calculators are not allowed on exams or
  quizzes and not required for the course.
</p>
