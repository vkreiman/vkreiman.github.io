<p><b>Meeting Place and Times</b><br /> Synchronous online, 9:00 -
  9:53 am M - F</p>

<p><b>Textbook</b><br />
  Stewart, <i>Calculus</i>, 8th edition (2012), Cengage</p>

<p><b>Course Description</b><br /> Introductory differential and
  integral calculus and applications. Topics include rate of change
  and limits, continuity, differentiation, applications of the
  derivative, integration, applications of the integral, and
  transcendental functions. We will cover most of chapters 1 - 6 from
  the textbook.</p>

<p><b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned in class; most
  will be taken from the textbook. You may certainly discuss homework
  problems with others, but I recommend that you first try to solve
  them on your own.</p>

<p><b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, three
  in-class exams, and periodic quizzes. The final exam will be on
  Saturday May 8, 1 - 3 pm. Each of the in-class exams will be
  announced in class at least one week before it is given.The final
  grade will be calculated using the following weights: quizzes 20%;
  in-class exams 20% each; final exam 20%. Your lowest two quiz scores
  will be dropped. The following grading scale will be applied: 90 -
  100 A, 80 - 89 B, 70 - 79 C, 60 - 69 D, 0 - 59 F.</p>

<p><b>Missed work</b><br />
  In-class exams and quizzes may be made up in the event of documented
  illness.</p>

<p><b>Calculators</b><br />
  Calculators are not allowed on exams or quizzes and not
  required for the course.</p>
