  <b>Course Description</b><br /> In this course we study the
  theoretical framework of calculus, including the fundamental
  properties of real numbers, sequences, series, limits, continuity,
  uniform continuity, topology of the real numbers and metric
  spaces, compactness, derivatives, integrals.  We will cover most
  of Chapters 3 - 8 of the textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> You will have to spend a substantial amount of
  time outside of class reading, thinking, and solving problems.
  Homework problems will require writing rigorous proofs.  Although
  you are permitted to discuss homework problems with other students,
  I encourage you to try them by yourself first. You must write up
  your own homework solutions. Approximately 18 homework assignments
  will be collected. Selected problems will be graded.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on two one-hour
  exams (25% each), quizzes (5%), homework (20%), and a
  comprehensive final exam (25%). The final exam will be from 1:00
  pm - 3:00 pm, Friday May 14, 2020.
