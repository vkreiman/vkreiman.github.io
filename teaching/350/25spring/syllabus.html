  <b>Course Description</b><br /> In this course we study the
  theoretical framework of calculus, including the fundamental
  properties of real numbers, sequences, series, limits, continuity,
  uniform continuity, topology of the real numbers and metric spaces,
  compactness, derivatives, and integrals.  We will cover most of
  Chapters 3 - 8 of the textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> You will have to spend a substantial amount of
  time outside of class reading, thinking, and solving problems.
  Homework problems will require writing rigorous
  proofs. Approximately 15 homework assignments will be
  collected. Selected problems will be graded.  Please feel free to
  ask me in office hours or before, during, or after class any
  questions you may have about the problems or the course in general.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Collaboration</b><br /> Although you are permitted to discuss
  homework problems with other students, you should try to solve them
  by yourself first. Moreover, your write-ups must be your own. This
  means, specifically, that when you write your solutions or proofs,
  (i) you may not look at anyone else's, and (ii) you may not copy or
  paraphrase material from any source other than lecture notes or our
  textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on two one-hour exams
  (30% each), homework (10%), and a comprehensive final exam
  (30%). <!-- The final exam will be from 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM, Friday May 10,
  2024.-->
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> Late homeworks will not be accepted.
