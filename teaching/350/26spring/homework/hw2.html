    <h2>Homework 2: Infimums, Supremums</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions.  Assignments should be
	<b>stapled</b> and written clearly and legibly. </i>
    </p>

    <ol>
      
      <li> Section 3.3, #3(b), (d), (f), (g), (h), 5, 8.</li>

      <li> Suppose that \(A\) and \(B\) are two nonempty sets of real
	numbers such that \(x\leq y\) for all \(x\) in \(A\) and \(y\)
	in \(B\). In this problem you will prove that \(\sup A\leq
	\inf B\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Give an upper bound for \(A\) and give a lower bound
	  for \(B\).</li>
	  <li> Explain how we know that both \(\sup A\) and \(\inf B\)
	    must exist.</li>
	  <li> <b>Prove</b> that \(\sup A\leq y\) for all \(y\in
	  B\).</li>
	  <li> Use part (c) and the definition of \(\inf B\)
	    to <b>prove</b> that \(\sup A\leq \inf B\).</li>
	  <li> Can one say that \(\max A\leq \min B\)? Justify your
	  answer.</li>
