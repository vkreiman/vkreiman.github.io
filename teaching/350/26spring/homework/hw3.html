     <h2>Homework 3: Absolute Value, More Supremums</h2>

     <p><i>Instructions.  Assignments should be
	 <b>stapled</b> and written clearly and legibly. </i>
     </p>

     <ol>
       <li>Section 3.2, #6(b), 6(c). (For problem 6(c), I recommend
       that you first solve problem 4 below.) </li>

       <li> Let \(a \lt b\) be real numbers and consider the set \(T=
	 \mathbb{Q}\cap [a,b]\). Prove that \(\ssup T=b\). You may use
	 any of the theorems from class.</li>

       <li> Suppose that \(A\) and \(B\) are nonempty bounded sets in
	 \(\bR\) and that \(\ssup A\lt\ssup B\).  Prove that there
	 exists \(b\in B\) that is an upper bound for \(A\). Then show
	 by example that this is not always the case if we only assume
	 \(\ssup A\leq \ssup B\).</li>


       <li> Let \(a, b\) be real numbers. Prove that if \(a\lt
	 b+\epsilon\) for every \(\epsilon\in \bR\) such that
	 \(\epsilon>0\), then \(a\leq b\).</li>

       <li>
	 For each of the following, find all real numbers \(x\) which
	 satisfy the inequality. Express your answers using interval
	 notation.
	 <ol class="nested-list">
	   <li>\(|x + 3| \lt 1\)</li>

	   <li>\(|x-1| + |x-2| \gt 1\)</li>

	   <li>\( |x-1| + |x-1| \gt 1\)</li>
	   <li>\( |x-1| - |x-1| \gt 1\)</li>
	 </ol>
       </li>

       <li>Prove that if \(a\lt x \lt b\) and \(a \lt y \lt b\) then
	 \(|x- y| \lt b-a\).
       </li>

     </ol>
