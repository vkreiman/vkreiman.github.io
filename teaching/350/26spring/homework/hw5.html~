      <li> Prove that for every integer \(b\), there exists a positive
	integer \(a\) such that \(|a-|b||\leq 1\).</li>

      <li> Prove that for every positive real number \(e\), there
	exists a positive real number \(d\) such that if \(x\) is a
	real number with \(|x| \lt d\), then \(2|x|\lt e\).</li>

      <li> Prove that for every positive real number \(\epsilon\),
	there exists a natural number \(N\) such that if \(n \gt N\),
