    <h2>Homework 5: The Limit of a Sequence</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions.  Assignments should be
	<b>stapled</b> and written clearly and legibly. </i>
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li> Section 4.1, #6(c)(d), 14.</li>

      <li> Using only the definition of a limit, prove
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> \( \lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \dfrac{n^2-2}{n^4+2}=0\)</li>

	  <li> \( \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\,
	  \dfrac{2n-2}{5n+3}=\dfrac{2}{5}\)</li>

	  <li> \( \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\,
	  \Bigg(5-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n+\sqrt{n}+12}}\Bigg)=5\)</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Consider the following definition:
	<i>A sequence \((a_n)\) is said to
	  <b>reverge</b> to \(L\) if there exists \(\epsilon>0\)
	  such that for every \(N\in\mathbb{N}\), whenever \(n\geq N\), we
	  have \(|a_n-L|\lt \epsilon\).</i>

	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Give an example of a sequence that reverges.</li>
	  <li> If a sequence reverges, must it also converge? If not,
	    give a counterexample.</li>
	  <li> Is it possible for a sequence to reverge to two
	    different values?</li>
	  <li> (optional) If possible, give a simpler definition of
	    revergence.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      

      <li> Suppose that a sequence \((a_n)\) converges to 0, and that
	at least one term \(a_n\) of the sequence is greater than
	\(0\). Prove that the set \(\{a_n\}\) has a maximum.
      </li>

    </ol>
