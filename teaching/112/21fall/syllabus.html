<p>
  <b>Meeting Times and Place</b><br /> MTuWF 10:00 - 10:53 am, MOLN
  L222.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Prerequisites</b><br /> Math 111 with a grade of C or better; or
  equivalent; or appropriate placement score.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Required Textbook</b><br />
  Stewart, <i>Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus</i>, seventh edition.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Topics include functions and
  graphs, polynomial functions, exponential and logarithmic
  functions, sequences, series, and combinatorics. We will cover
  parts of chapters 1 - 4, 10, and 12 from the textbook. </p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned in class; most
  will be taken from the textbook. You may discuss homework problems
  with other students, but I recommend that you first try to solve
  them on your own.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, three
  in-class exams, and periodic quizzes. The final exam will be given
  on Saturday December 11, 1:00 - 3:00 pm. Each of the in-class exams
  will be announced in class at least one week before it is given.The
  final grade will be calculated using the following weights: quizzes
  20%; in-class exams 20% each; final exam 20%. Your two lowest quiz
  scores will be dropped. The following grading scale will be applied:
  94 - 100 A, 90 - 93 A-, 88 - 89 B+, 84 - 87 B, 80 - 83 B-, 78 - 79
  C+, 74 - 77 C, 70 - 73 C-, 64 - 69 D, 60 - 63 D-, 0 - 59 F.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> In-class exams may be made up in the
  event of documented illness.  If you miss an exam, you need to
  inform me before the time of the exam. Exams must be made up
  within one day of the original exam date. There are no makeup
  quizzes.</p>

<p>
  <b> Studying</b><br /> A general rule for this course is for
  every 1 hour spent in a class you should spend 1 to 3 hours
  outside of class studying.  If it is a difficult class for
  you, you may need to spend more time than this.  In math
  people often think: I did the homework; that's all the
  studying I need to do.  Reading your notes and reviewing your
  homework, quizzes, and exams are also excellent ways to help
  you succeed in this course.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Calculators</b><br /> A calculator with logarithmic functions
  will be required for at least one quiz in chapter
  4. Calculators are not allowed on the other exams and
  quizzes. Cell phones, tablets, and laptops are not acceptable
  forms of a calculator.
