  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Introduction to linear algebra
  including systems of equations, matrices, determinants, vector
  spaces and linear transformations, diagonalization, orthogonality
  and least squares. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The only way to learn this subject is to spend
  a substantial amount of time thinking about it. This is one purpose
  of the homework assignments. To a greater extent than in 200 level
  courses, you will be required to solve homework problems which are
  not worked out in lecture or in the textbook. You may certainly
  discuss the problems with other students. However, I encourage you
  to first try to solve homework problems by yourself. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on homework and one
  quiz (15%), two in-class exams (the first counts 25%, the second
  30%), and a comprehensive final exam (30%).  The final exam will be
  from 5:45 pm - 7:45 pm, Wednesday, December 14, 2022.

  <b>Missed work</b><br /> Late homeworks will not be accepted.
