    <h2>Homework 13: Standard Matrices, Compositions </h2>

<!--    <p><i>Instructions. Problems 7 and 8 are optional.</i></p> -->
    
    <ol>

      <li> Section 8.2, #20, 26.</li>
      
      <li> Section 8.3, #2, 4, 10(b). (Please provide
      justifications.)</li>

      <li> Consider \(T:P_2\to P_2\) defined by \(T(p(x))=p'(x)\),
	where \(p'(x)\) is the derivative of \(p(x)\). Prove that
	\(T\) is linear. Then determine \(\ker(T)\) and
	\(R(T)\). Verify that Theorem 2.5 holds for \(T\).
      </li>
      
      <li> Consider the linear transformation \(T: P_3\to P_3\) given
	by \(T(p(x))=xp'(x)\). Determine \(\ker(T)\) and \(R(T)\).
      </li>
      
      <li> Consider \(T:P_2\to P_2\) given by \(T(p(x))=p(x)+p'(x)\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(T\) is linear.</li>
	  <li> Prove that \(T\) is
	    an isomorphism.</li>
	  <li> Give \(\ker(T)\) and \(R(T)\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <li> Give an example of a linear operator \(T:\bR^2\to \bR^2\)
	such that \(\ker (T)=R(T)\).
      </li>

      <li> (Optional) Prove that if \(T:V\to W\) is an isomorphism,
	then so is \(T^{-1}:W\to V\).
      </li>
      
      <li> (Optional) Let \(T:V\to W\) be a linear transformation, and
	let \(Y\) be a subspace of \(W\). The <b>inverse image</b>
	of \(Y\), denoted \(T^{-1}(Y)\), is defined to be $$
	T^{-1}(Y)=\{\bv\in V: T(\bv)\in Y\} $$ Prove that
	\(T^{-1}(Y)\) is a subspace of \(V\).<br>

	<i> Note: The symbol \(T^{-1}\) is used to represent both the
	  inverse image, as defined in this problem, and the inverse
	  transformation, as defined in class on Wednesday and used in
	  Problem 6. Although the same symbol is used for both, they
	  are different concepts.</i>
