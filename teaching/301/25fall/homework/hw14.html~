    <h2>Homework 13: Standard Matrices, Compositions </h2>

<!--    <p><i>Instructions. Problems 7 and 8 are optional.</i></p> -->
    
    <ol>

      <li> Section 1.3, #5(a), (b).</li>

      <li> Section 4.10, #9, 11.</li>

      <li> Find the standard matrix for each of the following linear
	transformations.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> \(S:\bR^2\to \bR^2\) given by rotating \(2\theta\)
	    <b>clockwise</b> about the origin.</li>
	  <li> \(T:\bR^2\to \bR^2\) given by reflecting across the
	  line \(y=-x\).</li>
	  <li> \(R:\bR^3\to \bR^3\) given by rotating \(180^{\circ}\)
	    about the line passing through points \((-1,0,-1)\) and
	    \((1,0,1)\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Find the result of rotating the vector \(\vthree{2}{4}{7}\)
	by 180\(^{\circ}\) about the line through the points
	\((-1,0,-1)\) and \((1,0,1)\).
      </li>
      
      <li> In \(\bR^3\), let \(T\) be counterclockwise rotation by
	\(\theta\) about the \(z\)-axis, and let \(S\) be
	counterclockwise rotation by \(\psi\) about the
	\(y\)-axis. (Here counterclockwise means as viewed from the
	positive axis.) Let \(R\) be counterclockwise rotation by
	\(\theta\) about the \(z\)-axis followed by counterclockwise
	rotation by \(\psi\) in \(\bR^3\) about the \(y\)-axis. Find
	standard matrices for \(T\), \(S\), and \(R\).<br>

	<i>Hint: The standard matrix for \(R\) is obtained by
	multiplying the other two matrices (in the correct order).</i>
      </li>
      
      <li> In this problem you will prove the following trigonometric
	identities:

	$$ <!-- --> \begin{align} <!-- --> \cos(x+y)&=\cos x \cos y-
	\sin x \sin y\\ <!-- --> \sin(x+y)&= \sin x \cos y + \cos x
	\sin y <!-- --> \end{align} <!-- --> $$

	Use the following strategy. Let \(T\) be counterclockwise
	rotation by \(x\) and \(S\) counterclockwise rotation by \(y\)
	(both in \(\bR^2\)). Find the standard matrix for \(S\circ T\)
	in two ways: (i) by multiplying the standard matrices for
	\(S\) and \(T\), and (ii) by observing that \(S\circ T\) is
	rotation by \(x+y\). The matrices obtained in (i) and (ii)
	must be equal, so their entries must be equal.
      </li>
      
      <li> Use the trigonometric identities in Problem 6 to find
	formulas for \(\cos (2x)\) and \(\sin (2x)\).
      </li>

      <li> Suppose that there exists a linear transformation from
	\(V\) <i>onto</i> \(W\), where both \(V\) and \(W\) are
	finite-dimensional vector spaces. Is it possible for the
	dimension of \(W\) to be greater than the dimension of \(V\)?
	Justify your answer.
      </li>

      <li> Give an isomorphism \(T:M_{2,3}\to \bR^6\). No
	justification required.
      </li>
	    
      <li> Give an example of a transformation \(T:\bR^2\to \bR^2\)
	which is bijective but not an isomorphism.
      </li>
