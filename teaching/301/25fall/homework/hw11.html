    <h2>Homework 11: One-to-One, Onto</h2>

    <p>
      <i>Instructions. Assignments should be stapled and written
	clearly and legibly. Problems 5 and 6 are optional.</i>
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Section 8.2, #6, 7, 19(a)(c).  Make sure to justify your
	solutions to Exercise 7.
      </li>

      <li>` Determine whether the mappings given in Problems 3 and 4
	of
	<a href="https://vkreiman.github.io/teaching/301/25fall/homework/hw10.html">
	  Homework 10</a> are one-to-one. Justify your answers.</li>

      <li> Let \(T\colon V\to W\) be linear transformation, and let
	\(\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\}\) be linearly independent in \(V\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that if \(T\) is one-to-one, then
	    \(\{T(\bv_1),\ldots,T(\bv_p)\}\) is linearly independent
	    in \(W\).<br>

	    <i> Hint. Begin the proof as follows: ``Suppose \(c_1
	      T(\bv_1)+\cdots + c_p T(\bv_p)=\bz\). I must show that
	      \(c_1=\cdots =c_p=0\).''</b>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li> Give an example showing that if \(T\) is not
	    one-to-one, then \(\{T(\bv_1),\ldots,T(\bv_p)\}\) need not
	    be linearly independent in \(W\).
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Let \(T\colon V\to W\) be a linear transformation, with
	\(\dim V=n\), \(\dim W=m\). Prove the following:
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> \(\dim (R(T))\leq n\).</li>
	  <li> \(\dim (R(T))= n\) if and only if \(T\) is
	  one-to-one.</li>
	  <li> \(\dim (R(T))=m\) if and only if \(T\) is onto.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li>(GRE Mathematics Subject Test) Let \(V\) be the vector space
	of all \(2\times 3\) matrices, and let \(W\) be the vector
	space of all \(4\times 1\) column vectors. If \(T\) is a
	linear transformation from \(V\) \underline{onto} \(W\), what
	is the dimension of the subspace \(\{ \bv \in V: T(\bv)=\bz
	\}\)?  (Circle the correct answer and explain your
	reasoning.)
