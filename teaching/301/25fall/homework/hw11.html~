    <h2>Homework 10: Kernel, Range</h2>

    <p>
      <i>Instructions. Assignments should be stapled and written
	clearly and legibly. Problems 5 and 6 are optional.</i>
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>8.1, #10, 11, 24.</li>

      <li> Let \(V\) and \(W\) be vector spaces, and let \(T:V\to W\) be
	linear. Prove that if \(\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\}\) spans \(V\), then
	\(\{T(\bv_1),\ldots,T(\bv_p)\}\) spans \(R(T)\).
      </li>

      <li> Define a map \(T:\bR^3 \to F(-\infty,\infty)\) by $$
	T\left(\vthree{a}{b}{c}\right) = a \cos^2 x + b \sin^2 x + c $$
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(T\) is linear.</li>
	  <li> Find a nonzero vector in \( \ker T\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Define a map \(T:\bR^3 \to F(-\infty,\infty)\) by $$
	T\left(\vthree{a}{b}{c}\right) = a \cos x + b \sin x + c $$
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(T\) is linear.</li>
	  <li> Find \( \ker T\). Prove your answer.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
	
      <li> Let \(T:V\to W\) be a linear transformation. Let \(w\) be
	an element of \(W\), and let \(v_0\) be an element of \(V\)
	which \(T\) maps to \(w\). Prove that the set of all vectors
	which \(T\) maps to \(w\) is equal to \(\{v_0+u: u \in \ker
	T\}\). (Note that this is not, in general, a subspace of
	\(V\). Why not?)</li>

      <li> (Differential Equations) Let
	\(V=W=C^{\infty}(-\infty,\infty)\) be the vector space of
	infinitely differentiable functions. Let \(T:V\to W\) be the
	linear transformation $$T(f) =
	a_mf^{(m)}+a_{m-1}f^{(m-1)}+\cdots + a_1f,$$ where
	\(f^{(i)}\) denotes the \(i\)-th derivative of \(f\), and
	\(a_m,a_{m-1},\ldots, a_1\) are constants.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Recall that \(\ker T = \{f\in V: T(f)=0\}\). In terms
	    of differential equations, what does \(\ker T\)
	    represent?</li>

	  <li> Let \(g\in W\), and let \(H=\{h\in V: T(h)=g\}\). In
	    terms of differential equations, what does \(H\)
	    represent?</li>

	  <li> Let \(h_0\) be any element of \(H\). Use Problem 5 to
	    prove that \(H=\{h_0+f: f \in \ker T\}\).</li>
