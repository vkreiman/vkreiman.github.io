    <h2>Homework 17: Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization, Determinants</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions. Problem 5 is optional.</i></p>
    
    <ol>

      <li> Section 6.3, #10, 14, 37, 42(b), 43.</li>

      <li> Section 2.1, #22, 28, 30.</li>

      <li> Section 2.3, #8.</li>

      <li> Section 5.1, #3, 4, 33.  For all of these problems, you
	should not use determinants.</li>

      <li> Let \(T:\bR^3\to \bR^3\) be the linear transformation given
	by reflecting across the plane \(x_1-2x_2+2x_3=0\). The goal
	of this problem is to find the standard matrix for \(T\).
	<ol class="nested-list">

	  <li> Find an orthogonal basis \(B=\{\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3\}\)
	    for \(\bR^3\) such that \(\bv_1,\bv_2\) span the
	    plane. There are several ways to do this. Here is one:
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li> 1. Find a vector \(\bv_3\) which is orthogonal to
		all vectors on the plane. (This is covered in MATH
		223. No calculations are required.)</li>

	      <li> 2. Find two vectors \(\bu_1,\bu_2\) which span the
	      plane.<li>

	      <li> 3. Use the Gram-Schmidt process to replace
		\(\bu_1,\bu_2\) by two orthogonal vectors
		\(\bv_1,\bv_2\) which span the plane.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li> Find \([T]_B\).</li>
	  
	  <li> Use the change of basis formula to find \([T]_{B'}\),
	    where \(B'\) is the standard basis for \(\bR^3\).<br>

	    <i>Answer</i>: \( [T]_{B'}= \frac{1}{9} \begin{bmatrix}
	    \pe 7 & \pe 4 & -4\\ \pe 4 & \pe 1 & \pe 8\\ -4 & \pe 8 & \pe
	    1 \end{bmatrix} \)
	  </li>

	  
	  <li> Find the reflection of \(\vthree{\pe 1}{\pe 1}{-1}\)
	    across the plane.</li>
	</ol>
