<!--    <p><i>Instructions. Problems 7 and 8 are optional.</i></p> -->
    
    <ol>

      <li> Section 6.1, #36, 44.</li>

      <li> Section 6.2, #37, 39, 40, 41, 42.</li>

      <li>Let \(T:\bR^3\to \bR^3\) be rotation by \(\theta\) about the
	line through \(\vthree{0}{1}{1}\) (counterclockwise, as viewed
	from the tip of \(\vthree{0}{1}{1}\)).  Let \(\cB\) be the the
	following basis of \(\bR^3\): $$ \cB= \left\{
	\vthree{1}{0}{0},
	\vthree{0}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}},
	\vthree{0}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} \right\}.
	$$ Let \(\cB'=\{\be_1,\be_2,\be_3\}\), the standard basis for
	\(\bR^3\).
      </li>
	
      <ol class="nested-list">

	<li> Verify that \(\cB\) is an orthonormal basis for
	  \(\bR^3\).</li>

	<li> Find \([T]_{\cB}\).</li>
	
	<li> Use the change of basis formula to find \([T]_{\cB'}\),
	  the standard matrix for \(T\).</li>

	<li> Using (c), find the rotation of \(\vthree{3}{4}{5}\) by
	  \(\pi/3\) about the line through \(\vthree{0}{1}{1}\).</li>

      </ol>

      <i>Note. For this problem, you should use the Euclidean inner
	product (i.e., the dot product) on \(\bR^3\).</i>
