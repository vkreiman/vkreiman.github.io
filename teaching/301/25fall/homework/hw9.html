    <h2>Homework 9: Linear Transformations</h2>

    <p>
      <i>Instructions. Assignments should be stapled and
	written clearly and legibly.</i>
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Let \(T:V\to W\) be a linear transformation, and let
	\(\{\bv_1,\bv_2,\ldots,\bv_n\}\) be a set of vectors that
	spans \(V\). Prove that if $$
	T(\bv_1)=T(\bv_2)=\cdots=T(\bv_n)=\mathbf{0}, $$ then
	\(T(\bu)=\mathbf{0}\) for all vectors \(\bu\) in \(V\).<br>

	<i> Hint. Use Theorem 2.1.</i>
      </li>

      <li>
	Let \(T:V\to W\) be a linear transformation.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li>
	    Suppose that \(\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\}\) is a linearly
	    dependent set of vectors in \(V\). Using the definition of
	    linear dependence and Theorem 2.1, prove that
	    \(\{T(\bv_1),\ldots,T(\bv_p)\}\) is linearly dependent in
	    \(W\).<br>

	    <i> Hint. Begin the proof as follows: ``Since
	      \(\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\}\) is linearly dependent, there
	      exist scalars \(c_1,\ldots,c_p\) which are not all zero
	      for which \(c_1\bv_1+\cdots+c_p\bv_p=\mathbf{0}\).''</i>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Suppose that \(\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\}\) is a linearly
	    independent set of vectors in \(V\). Is
	    \(\{T(\bv_1),\ldots,T(\bv_p)\}\) necessarily linearly
	    independent in \(W\)? Is yes, prove it. If no, give a
	    counterexample.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <li> Determine whether each of the following transformations
	\(T\) is linear. Prove your answers.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> \(T:\bR^2\to \bR^2\) defined by
	    \(T(\vtwo{x_1}{x_2})=\vtwo{4x_1-2x_2}{3|x_2|}\).</li>
	  <li> \(T:\bR^2\to \bR^3\) defined by
	    \(T(\vtwo{x_1}{x_2})=\vthree{x_1-2x_2}{x_1+3x_2}{3x_1-4x_2}\).</li>
	  <li> \(T:P_2\to P_2\) defined by \(T(a+bx+cx^2)=a +
	    b(x+1)+b(x+1)^2\).</li>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	Show that each of the following transformations \(T:\bR^2\to
	\bR^2\) is linear by finding a matrix \(A\) such that
	\(T(\bx)=A\bx\). Describe geometrically what each
	transformation does.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> \(T(\vtwo{x_1}{x_2})=\vtwo{-x_1}{\pe x_2}\)</li>
	  <li> \(T(\vtwo{x_1}{x_2})=\vtwo{x_2}{x_1}\)</li>
	  <li> \(T(\vtwo{x_1}{x_2})=\vtwo{0}{x_2}\)</li>
	  <li> \(T(\bx)=-\bx\)</li>
	  <li> \(T(\bx)=\frac{1}{2}\bx\)</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <!-- <ol class="nested-list"> -->
      </ol>
