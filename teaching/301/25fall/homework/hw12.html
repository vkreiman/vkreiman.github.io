    <h2>Homework 12: Compositions, Inverse Transformations,
            Isomorphisms</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions. Problem 7 is optional.</i></p>
    
    <ol>

      <li> Section 8.2, #20, 26.</li>
      
      <li> Section 8.3, #2, 4, 10(b). (Please provide
      justifications.)</li>

      <li> Consider \(T:P_2\to P_2\) defined by \(T(p(x))=p'(x)\),
	where \(p'(x)\) is the derivative of \(p(x)\). Prove that
	\(T\) is linear. Then determine \(\ker(T)\) and
	\(R(T)\). Verify that Theorem 2.5 holds for \(T\).
      </li>
      
      <li> Consider the linear transformation \(T: P_3\to P_3\) given
	by \(T(p(x))=xp'(x)\). Determine \(\ker(T)\) and \(R(T)\).
      </li>
      
      <li> Consider \(T:P_2\to P_2\) given by \(T(p(x))=p(x)+p'(x)\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(T\) is linear.</li>
	  <li> Prove that \(T\) is
	    an isomorphism.</li>
	  <li> Give \(\ker(T)\) and \(R(T)\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <li> Give an example of a linear operator \(T:\bR^2\to \bR^2\)
	such that \(\ker (T)=R(T)\).
      </li>
      
      <li> (Optional) Let \(T:V\to W\) be a linear transformation, and
	let \(Y\) be a subspace of \(W\). The \textbf{inverse image}
	of \(Y\), denoted \(T^{-1}(Y)\), is defined to be $$
	T^{-1}(Y)=\{\bv\in V: T(\bv)\in Y\} $$ Prove that
	\(T^{-1}(Y)\) is a subspace of \(V\).<br>

	<i> Note: The symbol \(T^{-1}\) is used to represent both the
	  inverse image, as defined above, and the inverse
	  transformation, as defined in class on Wednesday. Although
	  the same symbol is used for both, they are different
	  concepts.</i>
