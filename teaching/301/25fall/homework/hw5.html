    <h2>Homework 5: Linear Independence</h2>

<!--
    <p><i>Instructions. All answers to textbook problems should be
      justified.  For problems 5 and 6 (except 6(c)), you may not Theorems
      1.2 or 1.3 from the study guide.  Assignments should be
      <b>stapled</b> and written clearly and legibly. Problem 7 is
      optional.</i>

  <li>Section 4.3, \#3(a), 4(a), 15(b), 16(a)(c). Try to solve \#
    15(b) and 16(a) with as few computations as possible, and try to be
    fairly rigorous for 16(c).
  </li>


  <li>
    Let \(\{\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3,\bv_4\}\) be a linearly independent
    set of vectors in a vector space \(V\). Using only the definition of
    linear independence, prove that \(\{\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3\}\) is linearly
    independent as well.<br><br>

    Hint. Begin the proof as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \parbox{5.5in}{``Suppose that
    \(k_1\bv_1+k_2\bv_2+k_3\bv_3=\mathbf{0}\) for some scalars
    \(k_1, k_2, k_3\). I must show that \(k_1=k_2=k_3=0\).''}
    \end{center}
  </li>

  
    <li>
      Give an example of a nonempty subset of \(M_{2,3}\) which is not a
      subspace of \(M_{2,3}\).
    </li>

    <li> Sketch the following: (a) \(\sspan\{\vtwo{1}{2},
      \vtwo{2}{3}\}\), (b) \(\sspan\{\vtwo{1}{2}, \vtwo{2}{4}\}\), (c)
      \(\sspan\{\vtwo{0}{0}\}\),<br> (d)
      \(\sspan\left\{\vthree{1}{2}{3}\right\}\), (e)
      \(\sspan\left\{\vthree{1}{2}{0}, \vthree{1}{2}{3}\right\}\).
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Consider the set \( W \) of all vectors in \(\bR^4\) of the form
      \(\vfour{\pe a}{\pe b}{-2b}{\pe a}\). Verbally, we can describe
      \(W\) as the set of all vectors in \(\bR^4\) whose first and
      fourth components are equal, and whose third component is -2
      times its second component.  Using set-builder notation, we can express
      \(W\) as \[ W = \left\{ \vfour{\pe a}{\pe b}{-2b}{\pe a} : a, b
      \text{ are real numbers}\right\} \]

      Let \(\bu, \bv\), \(\bw\), \(\bx\), \(\by\), and \(\bzz\) be
      vectors in a vector space \(V\). Using only the definition of
      \(\sspan\) (and no theorems), prove that if \(\bzz\) is
      in \(\sspan\{\bx,\by\}\), and \(\bx\) and \(\by\) are in
      \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv,\bw\}\), then \(\bzz\) is in
      \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv,\bw\}\).

      Let \(\bu\), \(\bv\), \(\bw\) be vectors in a vector space
      \(V\).  Show directly that \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv\}\) is a <i>subset</i>
      of \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv,\bw\}\). <br>
	  <i>(Hint. You need to show that every vector in
	    \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv\}\) can be expressed as a linear
	    combination of the vectors \(\bu\), \(\bv\), and \(\bw\).)

      (Optional, Putnam Competition) Let \(S\) be a set and let \(\circ\) be a
      binary operation on \(S\) satisfying the two laws
      \begin{align*}
      &x \circ x = x \text{ for all \(x\) in \(S\), and}\\
      & (x \circ y)\circ z = (y\circ z)\circ x \text{ for all \(x,y,z\) in \(S\)}.
      \end{align*}
      Show that \(\circ\) is associative and commutative.
