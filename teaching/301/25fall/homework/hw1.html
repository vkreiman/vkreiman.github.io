    <h2>Homework 1: Systems of Linear Equations (Part 1)</h2>

<!--
    <p><i>Instructions. All answers to textbook problems should be
      justified.  For problems 5 and 6 (except 6(c)), you may not Theorems
      1.2 or 1.3 from the study guide.  Assignments should be
      <b>stapled</b> and written clearly and legibly. Problem 7 is
      optional.</i>

	Row reduce matrix \(A\) to reduced row echelon form. List the
	pivot columns of \(A\).
	$$
	A = \begin{bmatrix}[r]
	3 & 5 & 7 & 9 & 0\\
	2 & 6 & 10 & 14 & 0\\
	5 & 7 & 9 & 1 & 0
	\end{bmatrix}
	$$

      <li>
	Find the equation \(y=ax^2+bx+c\) of the parabola passing through
	the points \((-2,-6)\), \((1,6)\), and \((3,4)\). (Your answer should
	be an equation of the form \(y=ax^2+bx+c\), for some constants
	\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).)<br style="margin-bottom: .3em;">
	
	<i>Hint: Substituting the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates of a
	  point into the equation \(y=ax^2+bx+c\) will produce a linear
	  equation in \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Do this for the three
	  given points to get three linear equations. Then solve the
	  system of linear equations.
