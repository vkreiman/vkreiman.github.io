    <h2>Homework 5: Linear Independence</h2>

<!--
    <p><i>Instructions. All answers to textbook problems should be
      justified.  For problems 5 and 6 (except 6(c)), you may not Theorems
      1.2 or 1.3 from the study guide.  Assignments should be
      <b>stapled</b> and written clearly and legibly. Problem 7 is
      optional.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Instructions. In Problems 2 and 3, make sure to use the study
    guide's definition of linear independence. It is different from
    the textbook's definition.</i>

    <ol>

  <li>Section 4.3, #3(a), 4(a), 15(b), 16(a)(c). Try to solve
    15(b) and 16(a) with as few computations as possible, and try to be
    fairly rigorous for 16(c).
  </li>


  <li>
    Let \(\{\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3,\bv_4\}\) be a linearly independent
    set of vectors in a vector space \(V\). Using only the definition of
    linear independence, prove that \(\{\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3\}\) is linearly
    independent as well.<br>

    <i> Hint. Begin the proof as follows: ``Suppose that
    \(k_1\bv_1+k_2\bv_2+k_3\bv_3=\mathbf{0}\) for some scalars \(k_1,
    k_2, k_3\). I must show that
      \(k_1=k_2=k_3=0\).''
    </i>
  </li>

  <li>
    Using only the definition of linear independence, prove that if
    \(\{\bu,\bv,\bw\}\) is linearly independent, then so is
    \(\{\bu+\bv,\bu+\bw,\bv+\bw\}\).<br>

    <i> Hint. Begin the proof as follows: ``Suppose that \(c(\bu+\bv)+
      d(\bu+\bw)+ e(\bv+\bw)=\mathbf{0}\) for some scalars \(c, d,
      e\). I must show that \(c=d=e=0\).''
    </i>
  </li>

    <!--    
    <li>
      Let \(\bu\), \(\bv\), \(\bw\) be vectors in a vector space
      \(V\).  Show directly that \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv\}\) is a <i>subset</i>
      of \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv,\bw\}\). <br>
	  <i>(Hint. You need to show that every vector in
	    \(\sspan\{\bu,\bv\}\) can be expressed as a linear
	    combination of the vectors \(\bu\), \(\bv\), and \(\bw\).)
