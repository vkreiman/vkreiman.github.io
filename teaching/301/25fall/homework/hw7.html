    <h2>Homework 7: Basis and Coordinates</h2>

      <i>Instructions. Assignments should be <b>stapled</b> and
	written clearly and legibly.</i>

    <ol>

      <li>Section 4.4, #19(a)(b), 13(b), 14(b), 24(a)(b),
	27(a)(b).</li>

      <li>
	Suppose that \(\bu\), \(\bv\), and \(\bw\) are vectors in a vector
	space \(V\), and suppose that none of the three vectors \(\bu\),
	\(\bv\), or \(\bw\) is a <b>scalar multiple</b> of either of the
	other two vectors. In other words, \(\bu\) is not a scalar
	multiple of \(\bv\) or of \(\bw\); \(\bv\) is not a scalar multiple
	of \(\bu\) or of \(\bw\); and \(\bw\) is not a scalar multiple of
	\(\bu\) or of \(\bv\).  Is \(\{\bu, \bv, \bw\}\) necessarily
	linearly independent?  If so, prove it. If not, give a
	concrete counterexample.
      </li>


      <li>
	Suppose that \(\cB=\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\}\) is a linearly
	idependent set of vectors in a vector space \(V\). Prove that
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li>\(\sspan \cB\) is a subspace of \(V\).</li>
	  <li> \(\cB\) is a basis for \(\sspan \cB\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li>
	In this problem you will prove that \(\{e^x, e^{2x}\}\) is a
	basis for \(\sspan\{e^x, e^{2x}\}\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(\{e^x, e^{2x}\}\) is linearly independent
	    in \(F(-\infty, \infty)\). Use the method outlined in
	    Exercise 3 of
	    <a href="https://vkreiman.github.io/teaching/301/25fall/homework/hw6.html">
	    Homework 6</a>.</li>
	  <li> Prove that \(\sspan\{e^x, e^{2x}\}\) is a subspace of
	    \(F(-\infty, \infty)\).</li>
	  <li> Use Exercise 3 above to prove that \(\{e^x, e^{2x}\}\)
	    is a basis for \(\sspan\{e^x, e^{2x}\}\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	In Exercise 2
	of <a href="https://vkreiman.github.io/teaching/301/25fall/homework/hw6.html">
	Homework 6</a>, you found that \(\{1, \ln(2x), \ln(x^2)\}\) is
	linearly dependent in \(F(0,\infty)\). Let \(W=\sspan\{1,
	\ln(2x), \ln(x^2)\}\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> How do we know that \(W\) is a subspace of
	  \(F(0,\infty)\)?</li>
	  <li> Find a basis \(\cB\) for \(W\), and find \(\dim
	  W\).</li>
	  <li> Determine whether \(\ln (7x^{12})\) is in \(W\). If so,
	    find \([\ln(7x^{12})]_{\cB}\).</li>
	</ol>
	You should justify your answers, but proofs are not required.
      </li>

<!--
      <li> (Optional) To prove linear independence, we have been using
	Definition 1.7 of the course study guide. Prove that the three
	vectors of Section 4.3, #2(a) are linearly independent by
	instead using Theorem 1.4. You should find that more
	computations are required.

      <li> Section 4.4, #19(a)(b), 20.</li> 
  
      <li> Let \(\cB=\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\}\) be a set of vectors in a
	vector space \(V\) such that every vector \(\bu\) in \(V\) can
	be written in exactly one way as a linear combination of the
	vectors \(\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\). Prove that \(\cB\) is a basis
