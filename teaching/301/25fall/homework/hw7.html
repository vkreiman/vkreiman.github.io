    <h2>Homework 7: Basis and Coordinates</h2>

    <p>
      <i>Instructions. Assignments should be <b>stapled</b> and
	written clearly and legibly.</i>

    <ol>

      <li>Section 4.4, #19(a)(b), 13(b), 14(b), 24(a)(b),
	27(a)(b).</li>

      <li>
	Suppose that \(\bu\), \(\bv\), and \(\bw\) are vectors in a vector
	space \(V\), and suppose that none of the three vectors \(\bu\),
	\(\bv\), or \(\bw\) is a <b>scalar multiple</b> of either of the
	other two vectors. In other words, \(\bu\) is not a scalar
	multiple of \(\bv\) or of \(\bw\); \(\bv\) is not a scalar multiple
	of \(\bu\) or of \(\bw\); and \(\bw\) is not a scalar multiple of
	\(\bu\) or of \(\bv\).  Is \(\{\bu, \bv, \bw\}\) necessarily
	linearly independent?  If so, prove it. If not, give a
	concrete counterexample.
      </li>


      <li>
	Suppose that \(\cB=\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\}\) is a linearly
	idependent set of vectors in a vector space \(V\). Explain how
	we know that \(\sspan \cB\) is a subspace of \(V\). Then prove
	that \(\cB\) is a basis for \(\sspan \cB\).
      </li>

      <li>
	In this problem you will prove that \(\{2^x, 3^x\}\) is a
	basis for \(\sspan\{2^x, 3^x\}\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(\{2^x, 3^x\}\) is linearly independent
	    in \(F(-\infty, \infty)\). Use the method outlined in
	    Problem 3 of
	    <a href="https://vkreiman.github.io/teaching/301/25fall/homework/hw6.html">
	    Homework 6</a>.</li>
	  <li> Prove that \(\sspan\{2^x, 3^x\}\) is a subspace of
	    \(F(-\infty, \infty)\).</li>
	  <li> Use Problem 3 above to prove that \(\{2^x, 3^x\}\)
	    is a basis for \(\sspan\{2^x, 3^x\}\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	In Problem 2
	of <a href="https://vkreiman.github.io/teaching/301/25fall/homework/hw6.html">
	Homework 6</a>, you found that \(\{1, \ln(2x), \ln(x^2)\}\) is
	linearly dependent in \(F(0,\infty)\). Let \(W=\sspan\{1,
	\ln(2x), \ln(x^2)\}\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> How do we know that \(W\) is a subspace of
	    \(F(0,\infty)\)?</li>
	  <li> Find two separate bases \(\cB\) and \(\cC\) for \(W\),
	  and find \(\dim W\). Make sure to verify that each of your
	  two asserted bases is linearly independent, and then use
	  Problem 3 to justify that each is a basis.</li>
	  <li> Determine whether \(\ln (7x^{12})\) is in \(W\). If so,
	    find \([\ln(7x^{12})]_{\cB}\) and
	    \([\ln(7x^{12})]_{\cC}\), where \(\cB\) and \(\cC\) are
	    the bases you found in part (b).</li>
	</ol>
	You should justify your answers, but formal proofs are not
	required for this problem.
      </li>

      <li> Let \(\cB=\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\}\) be a set of vectors in a
	vector space \(V\) such that every vector \(\bu\) in \(V\) can
	be written in exactly one way as a linear combination of the
	vectors \(\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\). Prove that \(\cB\) is a basis
	for \(V\).</li>
