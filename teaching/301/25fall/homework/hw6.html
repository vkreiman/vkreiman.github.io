    <h2>Homework 6: Linear Independence Episode II</h2>

    <p>
      <i>Instructions. Assignments should be <b>stapled</b> and
	written clearly and legibly.</i>
    </p>
    
    
    <ol>

      <li>Section 4.3, #5(a), 12, 15(a)</li>

      <li> Determine whether \(\{1, \ln(2x),\ln(x^2)\}\) is linearly
	independent in \(F(0,\infty)\). Justify your answer (a) by
	using the definition of linear independence/linear dependence
	from class, and (b) by using Theorem 1.4 from the study
	guide.</li>

      <li> Recall that in class we proved \(\{ \cos^2 x,\sin^2 x, \cos
      2x \} \) is linearly dependent in \( F(-\infty,\infty) \) by
      using a trigonometric identity. Prove that, however, \(\{ \cos^2
      x,\sin^2 x, \cos x \} \) is linearly <i>independent</i> in \(
      F(-\infty,\infty) \). Use the following strategy:
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li>Assume that $$a \cos^2 x + b \sin^2 x + c \cos x = 0$$
	    in \(F(-\infty,\infty) \) for some scalars \(a, b,
	    c\).</li>
	  <li>Substituting any value for \(x\) into the above equation
	    will produce a linear equation in \(a\), \(b\), and
	    \(c\). Choose three values of \(x\) so that the three
	    produced linear equations form an inconsistent linear
	    system. (I recommend that you choose values of \(x\) for
	    which \(\cos x\) and \(\sin x\) are both simple
	    numbers.)</li>
	  <li> Explain why this implies that \(\{ \cos^2 x,\sin^2 x,
	    \cos x \} \) is linearly independent in \( F(-\infty,
	    \infty) \).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li>
	Let \(\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\) be vectors in a vector space
	\(V\). Prove the following:
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Let \(\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\) span the vector space \(V\), and let
	    \(\bu\) be any vector in \(V\).
	    Then \(\{\bu,\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_p\}\) is
	    linearly dependent.</li>

	  <li> Let \(\{\bv_1,\bv_2,\ldots,\bv_p\}\) be linearly
	    independent. Then \(\bv_2,\ldots,\bv_p\) cannot span \(V\).
	  </li>
	</ol>

	  <i>Hint. Use Theorem 1.4 from the study guide for both parts.</i>
      </li>

<!--
      <li> (Optional) To prove linear independence, we have been using
	Definition 1.7 of the course study guide. Prove that the three
	vectors of Section 4.3, #2(a) are linearly independent by
	instead using Theorem 1.4. You should find that more
	computations are required.
      </li>
-->
      
      <!--
      <li> Section 4.4, #19(a)(b), 20.</li> 
  
      <li> Let \(\cB=\{\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\}\) be a set of vectors in a
	vector space \(V\) such that every vector \(\bu\) in \(V\) can
	be written in exactly one way as a linear combination of the
	vectors \(\bv_1,\ldots,\bv_n\). Prove that \(\cB\) is a basis
	for \(V\).</li>
