  <b>Textbook</b><br /> Required: Colin Adams, Robert
  Franzosa, <i>Introduction to Topology: Pure and Applied</i>, 1st
  edition, Pearson, 2007.  <br />

  Supplemental Reading: James Munkres, <i>Topology</i>, 2nd edition,

  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Introduction to the theory of
  topological spaces, metric spaces, continuous functions,
  connectedness, and compactness. Time permitting, we will discuss
  other topics such as homotopy or fixed-point theorems.  We will
  cover most of Chapters 1 - 7 of the textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> You will have to spend a substantial amount of
  time outside of class reading, thinking, and solving problems.
  Homework problems will require writing rigorous proofs.  Although
  you are permitted to discuss homework problems with other students,
  I encourage you to try them by yourself first. You must write up
  your own homework solutions. Approximately 18 homework assignments
  will be collected. Selected problems will be graded.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on two one-hour exams
  (25% each), homework (25%), and a comprehensive final exam
  (25%). The final exam will be from 3:30 pm - 5:30 pm, Wednesday May
  12, 2021.
