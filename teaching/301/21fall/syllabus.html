  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Introduction to linear algebra
  including systems of equations, matrices, determinants, vector
  spaces and linear transformations, diagonalization, orthogonality
  and least squares.

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The only way to learn this subject is to spend
  a substantial amount of time thinking about it. This is one purpose
  of the homework assignments. To a greater extent than in 200 level
  courses, you will be required to solve homework problems which are
  not worked out in lecture or in the textbook. You may certainly
  discuss the problems with other students. However, I encourage you
  to first try to solve homework problems by yourself. Please feel
  free to ask me in office hours or before, during, or after class any
  questions you may have about the problems or the course in general.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on homework and
  quizzes (25%), two in-class exams (25% each), and a comprehensive
  final exam (25%).  The final exam will be from 5:45 pm - 7:45 pm,
  Wednesday December 15, 2021.

  <b>Missed work</b><br /> Late homeworks will not be accepted.
