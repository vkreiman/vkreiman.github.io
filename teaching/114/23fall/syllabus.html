  <b>Meeting Times and Place</b><br /> MTWThF 10:00 - 10:53 AM, GRNQ D101.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Prerequisites</b><br /> Math 111 with a grade of C or better; or
  equivalent; or appropriate placement score.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Required Textbook</b><br />
  Stewart, <i>Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus</i>, seventh edition.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Covers functions and graphs,
  polynomials and rational functions, exponential and logarithmic
  functions, trigonometric functions, trigonometric identities and
  equations, applications, sequences, series.  We will cover parts of
  chapters 1 - 7, 10, and 12 from the textbook. </p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems from a homework packet posted to
  Canvas will be collected almost every day. Additional problems from
  the textbook will be assigned but not collected. You may discuss
  homework problems with other students, but I recommend that you
  first try to solve them on your own.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, four
  in-class exams, seven quizzes, and homework. The final exam will be
  given on Saturday December 9, 1:00 - 3:00 pm. The dates of the
  in-class exams and quizzes are provided on the course calendar.
  Your two lowest quiz scores and five lowest homework scores will be
  dropped.  The final grade will be calculated using the following
  weights: homework 10%; quizzes 15%; in-class exams 15% each; final
  exam 15%.  The following grading scale will be applied: 92 - 100 A,
  90 - 91 A-, 88 - 89 B+, 82 - 87 B, 80 - 81 B-, 78 - 79 C+, 72 - 77
  C, 70 - 71 C-, 62 - 69 D, 60 - 61 D-, 0 - 59 F.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> In-class exams may be made up in the
  event of documented illness.  If you miss an exam, you need to
  inform me before the time of the exam. Exams must be made up
  within one day of the original exam date. There are no makeup
  quizzes.</p>

<p>
  <b> Studying</b><br /> A general rule for this course is for every 1
  hour spent in a class you should spend 1 to 3 hours outside of class
  studying.  If it is a difficult class for you, you may need to spend
  more time than this.  In math people often think: I did the
  homework; that's all the studying I need to do.  Reading your notes
  and reviewing your homework, quizzes, and exams are also excellent
  ways to help you succeed in this course.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Calculators</b><br /> You may use a scientific, non-graphping
  calculator for this course. It should have buttons for exponents,
  logarithms, and trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and
  tangent. Cell phones, tablets, and laptops are not acceptable forms
  of a calculator; they may not be used during quizzes or exams. If
  you are unsure if your calculator meets the requirements for this
  class, please ask me.
