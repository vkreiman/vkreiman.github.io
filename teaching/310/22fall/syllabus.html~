  will also cover topics in estimation and hypothesis testing.

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The only way to learn this subject is to spend
  a substantial amount of time thinking about it. This is one purpose
  of the homework assignments. To a greater extent than in 200 level
  courses, you will be required to solve homework problems which are
  not worked out in lecture or in the textbook. You may certainly
  discuss the problems with other students. However, I encourage you
  to first try to solve homework problems by yourself. Please feel
  free to ask me in office hours or before, during, or after class any
  questions you may have about the problems or the course in general.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on quizzes (25%), two
  in-class exams (25% each), and a comprehensive final exam (25%). The
  final exam will be from 1:00 - 3:00 pm, Friday December 17,
  2021. </p>
