  <h2>Homework 14: Independent Random Variables</h2>

  <ol>

    <li> Section 3.5, #7, 11.</li>
		   
    <li> Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be jointly continuous with joint pdf
      \(f_{X,Y}(x,y)=(24/5)(x+y)\), for \(0\leq 2y\leq x\leq 1\).
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find \(f_X(x)\) and \(f_Y(y)\).</li>
	<li> Are \(X\) and \(Y\) independent?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li> A point is chosen at random from the interior of a circle
      whose equation is \(x^2+y^2\leq 4\). Let the random variables
      \(X\) and \(Y\) denote the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates of a
      sampled point.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find \(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\).</li>
	<li> Find \(f_X(x)\) and \(f_Y(y)\).</li>
	<li> Are \(X\) and \(Y\) independent?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> A hat contains 3 red and 6 white slips of paper. You draw 2
      slips at random, without replacement.  Let \(X\) equal 1 if the
      first slip is red, and \(X\) equal 0 otherwise. Let \(Y\) equal
      1 if the second slip is red, and \(Y\) equal 0 otherwise. Use
      the definition of independence of random variables to determine
      whether \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent.
