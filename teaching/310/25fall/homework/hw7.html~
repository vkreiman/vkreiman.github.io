  <h2>Homework 6: Bayes' Theorem </h2>

  <ol>
    <li>A desk has three drawers. The first contains two gold
      coins, the second contains two silver coins, and the third contains
      one gold and one silver coin. A coin is drawn from a drawer selected
      at random. Suppose the selected coin is silver. What is the
      probability that the other coin in the drawer is gold?
    </li>

    <li>English and American spellings are <i>rigour</i>
      and <i>rigor</i>, respectively. A man staying at a Parisian
      hotel writes this word, and a letter taken at random from his
      spelling is found to be a vowel. If 40% of the English-speaking
      men at the hotel are English and 60% are American, what is the
      probability that the writer is an Englishman?
    </li>

    <li>Draw a card. If it's diamonds, place it back in the deck and
      draw another card. If the first card is not diamonds, then draw
      a second card without replacing the first card.  If one knows
      only that the second card drawn was the two of clubs, find the
      probability that the first card was diamonds.
    </li>

    <li>Next semester, Wisconsin Tech will offer 6 sections of a
      course called Advanced Probability. Professor X will teach 1 of
      the 6 sections; Professor Y will teach 2; and Professor Z will
      teach the remaining 3. Alice needs to take the course in order
      to graduate in May. She will choose a section randomly by
      rolling a 6-sided die.  She estimates that her probability of
      passing the course is 80% with Professor X, 60% with Professor
      Y, and 40% with Professor Z. Suppose that after the semester
      ends, we learn that Alice did, indeed, pass the course. What is
      the probability that she was enrolled in Professor X's section?
    </li>

    <li>At a card table in a casino in Reno, Nevada, a dealer deals
      from a standard deck of cards on weekdays and from a double deck
      (i.e., two standard decks combined) on weekends.  A man named
      Ace chose a day at random last summer to visit this casino. He
      sat down at the card table and was dealt four cards off the top
      of a shuffled stack of cards. All four were aces. What is the
      probability that it was a Tuesday?
