  <h2>Homework 21: Covariance</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Section 4.6, #5, 11.</li>

    <li> Suppose that \(X\) and \(Y\) have joint pdf

      $$ f_{X,Y}(x,y)= \begin{cases} \frac{4}{5}(xy+1), & 0\lt x\lt 1,
      0\lt y\lt 1\\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

      Find Cov\((X,Y)\), the covariance of \(X\) and \(Y\).
    </li>
    
    <li> Let \(X\) be uniformly distributed on \([-1,1]\), and let
      \(Y=X^2\). Show that Cov\((X,Y)=0\) even though \(X\) and \(Y\)
      are far from being indepedent: given the value of \(X\),
      \(Y=X^2\) is completely determined. Prove that \(X\) and \(Y\)
      are not independent.
    </li>
    
    <li> Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be independent, each with mean 2 and
      variance 1. Let \(U=3X+2Y\), \(V=2X-3Y\). Find Var \(U\) and
      Cov\((U,V)\).
    </li>
