  <h2>Homework 21: Covariance</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Section 4.6, #5, 11.</li>

    <li> Suppose that \(X\) and \(Y\) have joint pdf

      $$ f_{X,Y}(x,y)= \begin{cases} \frac{4}{5}(xy+1), & 0\lt x\lt 1,
      0\lt y\lt 1\\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

      Find Cov\((X,Y)\), the covariance of \(X\) and \(Y\).
    </li>
    
    <li> Let \(X\) be uniformly distributed on \([-1,1]\), and let
      \(Y=X^2\).
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Show that Cov\((X,Y)=0\).</li>
	<li> Prove that \(X\) and \(Y)\ are not independent.</li>
      </ol>
      Note that we've shown in class that the following holds: if two
      random variables are independent, then their covariance is
      0. This problem illustrates that the converse of this statement
      is false.
    </li>
    
    <li> Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be independent, each with mean 2 and
      variance 1. Let \(U=3X+2Y\), \(V=2X-3Y\). Find Var \(U\) and
      Cov\((U,V)\).
    </li>
  </ol>
