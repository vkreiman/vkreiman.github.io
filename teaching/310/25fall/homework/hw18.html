  <h2>Homework 18: Law of the Unconscious Statistician</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Let \(X\) have pdf $$ f_X(x)=2(1-x), 0\leq x\leq 1 $$ Suppose
      that \(Y=X^2\). Find \(E(Y)\) in two different ways.
    </li>
    
    <li> A box is to be constructed so that its height is five inches
      and its base is \(X\) inches by \(X\) inches, where \(X\) is a
      random variable with pdf \(f_X(x)=6x(1-x)\), \(0\lt x\lt 1\).
      Let \(V\) be the volume of the box. Find \(E(V)\).
    </li>
    
    <li> Suppose that the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is
      a random variable which is uniform over the interval
      \([4,10]\). Find the expected value of the area of the triangle.
    </li>
    
    <li> Grades on a recent math exam were fairly low. When graphed,
      the distribution of grades had a shape similar to the pdf $$
      f_X(x)=\frac{1}{5000}(100-x), \ 0\leq x \leq 100 $$ In order to
      ``curve'' the results, the professor announces that she will
      replace each grade \(X\) with a new grade \(g(X)\), where
      \(g(X)=10\sqrt{X}\). Will this curve raise the class average
      above 60?
    </li>

    <li> Suppose that the lifetime (in years) of a light bulb is a
      random variable \(X\) with pdf \(f_X(x)=0.5e^-{0.5x}\).  Sarah
      Connor buys a new bulb today, but when it burns out, she will
      have to buy another one. The price of a light bulb is currently
      \(3\) dollars.  Due to inflation, the price \(t\) years from now
      will be \(3e^{0.1 t}\) dollars.  Find the expected price of the
      second bulb.
    </li>
