  <h2>Homework 4: Combinatorics and Probability (Part 2)</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Alice buys 5 soup cans and Ben buys 4 soup cans from a shelf
      with 10 dented and 15 nondented cans. Find the probabilities that (a)
      Alice gets 2 dented and Ben gets 3 dented cans; (b) Alice gets 3
      dented cans.</li>

    <li>
      You are dealt 5 cards one by one from a standard deck. After picking
      up the first two cards, you see that one is the ace of hearts and the
      other is the seven of hearts. Knowing this, find the probability that
      after you pick up the remaining three cards you will have (a) 5
      hearts; (b) 3 aces and 2 sevens; (c) a full house; (d) exactly 2 aces
      and exactly 2 sevens.
