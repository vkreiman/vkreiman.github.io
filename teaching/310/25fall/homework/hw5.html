  <h2>Homework 5: Law of Total Probability</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Section 2.1, #2, 4, 13. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
      A multiple choice exam has 5 choices per question. On 75% of the
      questions, you think you know the answer; on the other 25% of
      the questions, you just guess at random. Unfortunately, when you
      think you know the answer, you are right only 80% of the
      time. Find the probability of getting an arbitrary question
      right.
      </li>

    <li>
      Scotty has $n$ keys of which one will open the door to the
      engine room.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> If he tries the keys at random, discarding those that do
	  not work, what is the probability that he will open the door
	  on the $k$th try?</li>
	<li> What if he does not discard the previously tried keys?
	</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> Draw a card. If it's diamonds, place it back in the deck and
      draw another card. If the first card is not diamonds, then draw
      a second card without replacing the first card.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find the probability that the second card is the queen or
	  king of diamonds.</li>
	<li> If the second card is the two of clubs, find the
	  probability that the first card was diamonds.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
