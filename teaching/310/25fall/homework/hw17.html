  <h2>Homework 17: Expectation</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> An urn contains four chips numbered 1 through 4. Two are
      drawn without replacement. Let the random variable \(X\) denote
      the larger of the two. Find \(E(X)\).</li>

    <li> A fair coin is tossed three times. Let the random variable
      \(X\) denote the total number of heads that appear times the
      number of heads that appear on the first and third tosses. Find
      \(E(X)\).
    </li>
    
    <li> A box contains 5 red and 5 blue marbles. Two marbles are
      drawn randomly. If they are the same color, then you win $1.10;
      if they are different colors, then you lose $1.00. Calculate the
      expected value your winnings.
    </li>
    
    <li> An arrow is fired at random into a circle of radius 8. (Note
      that the probability that it lands in any region of the circle
      depends on the <i>area</i> of the region.) If its distance from
      the center is
      \begin{align}
      0 \text{ to } 1 \text{ inches}:& \text{ win }$10\\
      1 \text{ to } 3 \text{ inches}:& \text{ win }$5\\
      3 \text{ to } 5 \text{ inches}:& \text{ win }$2\\
      5 \text{ to } 8 \text{ inches}:& \text{ lose }$4
      \end{align}
      Find the expected winnings.
    </li>

    <li> Suppose that teams A and B play in the world series, and that
        team A has a 60% chance of winning any game against team
        B. What is the expected number of games that will be played?
        (The series is the best of seven -- the first team to win four
      games wins the series.)
    </li>

    <li> Let \(X\) have pdf $$ f_X(x)=2(1-x), 0\leq x\leq 1 $$ Find
      \(E(X)\).
    </li>
