  <h2>Homework 10: The  Probability Density Function</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Section 3.3, #4, 5, 6, 8.</li>

    <li>The probability density function of \(X\), the lifetime of a
      certain electronic device (measured in hours), is given by
      $$
      f_X(x)=
      \begin{cases}
      \frac{10}{x^2}, & x>10\\
      0, & x\leq 10
      \end{cases}
      $$
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find \(P(X>20)\).</li>
	<li> What is the probability that of 6 such devices at least 3 will
	  function for at least 20 hours? What assumptions are you
	  making?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
