    <li> Section 3.2, #4, 5, 6, 8.</li>

    <li> Let \(X\) be the lifetime of a certain electronic device
      (measured in hours). Suppose that the probability density
      function of is given by $$ f_X(x)= \begin{cases} \frac{10}{x^2},
      & x>10\\ 0, & x\leq 10 \end{cases} $$
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find \(P(X>20)\).</li>
	<li> What is the probability that of 6 such devices at least 3 will
	  function for at least 20 hours? What assumptions are you
	  making?</li>
