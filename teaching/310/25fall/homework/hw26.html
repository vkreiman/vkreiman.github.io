  <h2>Homework 26: The Normal Distribution</h2>

  <ol>

    <li> Section 5.6, #13.</li>

    <li> Suppose that \(X\) is \(N_{-10,16}\) distributed. Find (a)
      \(P(X \gt -12)\), (b) \(P(-11 \lt X \lt -8)\).</li>

    <li> Suppose that the height, in inches, of a 25 year old man is a
      normal random variable with paraters \(\mu=71\) and
      \(\sigma^2=6.25\). What percentage of 25 year old men are over 6
      feet 2 inches tall? What percentage of men in the 6-footer club
      are over 6 foot 5 inches? How tall must a 25 year old man be in
      order to be in the top one percentile in height?</li>

    <li> Everyone in a school is weighed. 40% weigh over 110 pounds
      and 13% weigh over 170 pounds. Assume that weight is normally
      distributed.  Find the best choice for \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\).
    </li>
