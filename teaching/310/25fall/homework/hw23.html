  <h2>Homework 23: The Poisson Distribution</h2>

  <ol>

    <li> If \(P(H)=0.03\), then the probability of 2 Heads in 1000
      tosses is \(\binom{1000}{2}(.03)^{2}(.97)^{998}\). What is the
      Poisson approximation to this answer? Compare with the exact
      probability.</li>
    
    <li> Astronomers estimate that as many as one hundred billion
      stars in the Milky Way galaxy are encircled by planets. Let
      \(p\) denote the probability that any such solar system contains
      intelligent life. Use the Poisson distribution to estimate how
      small \(p\) can be and still give a fifty-fifty chance that we
      are not alone.</li>

    <li> A town in California has one earthquake every 8 months, on
      average.

      <ol class="nested-list">

	<li> What is the probability that the town has fewer than 3
	  earthquakes next year?</li>

	<li> What is the probability that the town has exactly 4
	  earthquakes in the next six years?</li>
      </ol>

    </li>
    
    <li> Records show that on average there are four deaths every 50
      days among residents of a large nursing home.  What is the
      probability that there will be exactly five deaths in the next
      80 days?
    </li>
    
    <li> Five hundred people are attending a large
      convention. Approximate the probability that at most two of the
      five hundred were born on Poisson's birthday.
    </li>
