  <h2>Homework 24: The Exponential Distribution</h2>

  <ol>

    <li> Suppose that commercial airplanes crash in a certain country
      at the rate of 2 per year.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> What is the probability that four or more crashes will
	  occur next year?</li>

	<li> What is the probability that the next crash will occur
	  between six and ten months from now?</li>

	<li> What is the probability that the next two crashes will
	  occur within two months of one another?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li> On average, a component in a certain machine lasts for 3
      years.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find the probability that a component lasts at least 4
	years.</li>

	<li> Suppose that the machine contains 6 of these
	  components. Find the probability that 4 components last at
	  least 3 years each, assuming that the components operate
	  independently of eachother.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> On average, a hard drive will work for 6 years before
      breaking down. If a person buys a new computer, what is the
      probability that the hard drive will still be working after 6
      years?  Solve this problem in two ways: (a) by using a Poisson
      random variable, and (b) by using an exponential random
      variable.
    </li>
