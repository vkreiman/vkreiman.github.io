  <h2>Homework 8: Discrete Random Variables</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Section 3.1, #2, 3.</li>

    <li>An urn contains seven balls numbered 1 to 7. Two balls are
      drawn simultaneously. Let \(X\) be the larger of the two numbers
      drawn. Find \(f_X(x)\).</li>

    <li>A fair die is tossed three times. Let \(X\) be the number of
      different faces that appear. Find \(f_X(x)\).
    </li>

<!--
    <li>Two dice are rolled. Let \(X\) be the product of the two
      dice. Find \(f_X(x)\).
    </li>
-->
    
    <li>Five men and five women are ranked according to their scores
      on an examination. Assume that no two scores are alike and all
      \(10!\) possible rankings are equally likely. Let \(X\) denote
      the highest ranking achieved by a woman. (For instance, \(X=1\)
      if the top-ranked person is a woman.) Find \(f_X(x)\).
    </li>

    <li>Let \(X\) be the difference between the number of heads and
      the number of tails when a coin is tossed \(n\) times. What are
      the possible values of \(X\)?
    </li>

    <li>An elementary school has 3 sixth-grade classes, each
      consisting of 20 students. From these 60 sixth-grade students, a
      committee of 3 students is selected at random. Let the random
      variable \(X\) be the number of different classes the three
      committee members are from. (For example, \(X=3\) if the
      committee members are all from different classes.) What are the
      different values \(X\) can take?  Find the probability function
      of \(X\).
