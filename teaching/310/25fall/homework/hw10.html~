  <h2>Homework 9: The Binomial Random Variable</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Section 3.1, #9.</li>

    <li> If you roll a die 6 times, what is the probability that
      exactly 3 of the rolls are twos? What is the probability that
      none of them are twos?</li>
    
    <li> In a local lumberyard, 10% of all boards are warped,
      twisted, or otherwise unusable. Suppose that a customer buys 50
      boards. Let \(X\) be the number of usable boards among the
      50. Find the probability function \(f_X(x)\).</li>

    <li> A certain airline company has two dilapidated airplanes, one
      with two engines, and the other with four. Each plane will land
      safely only if at least half of its engines are working. Each
      engine on each aircraft operates independently and each has
      probability \(p=0.4\) of failing. Assuming you wish to maximize
      your survival probability, which plane should you fly on?</li>

    <li>
      If a family has four children, is it more likely that they
      will have two boys and two girls or three of on sex and one of the
      other? Assume that the probability of a child being a girl is \(1/2\).
    </li>
    
    <li>
      A particle moves along the \(x\)-axis begining at 0. It moves
      one integer step to the left or right, with a move to the right
      being three times as likely as a move to the left. What is the
      p.f. of its position after six steps? What is the probability
      that after six steps the particle is back at where it started?
    </li>

    <li> Replicants are synthetic, robotic beings designed to look
      indistinuishable from humans.  In the near future, 20% of the
      population will be replicants.  The Voight-Kampff test (VK test
      for short) is used to distinguish replicants from humans. A
      human has a 90% chance of giving the correct response to a
      question on a VK test, whereas a replicant only has a 60%
      chance. On a 10 question test, Leon gives the correct response
      to 6 questions. What is the probability that Leon is a
      replicant?
