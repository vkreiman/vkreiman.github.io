  <h2>Homework 27: The Central Limit Theorem</h2>

  <ol>

    <li> Wisconsin Tech's basketball team, the Three Point One Four
      Shooters, have a 70% free-throw percentage.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Write a formula for the exact probability that out of
	  their next one hundred free throws, they will make between
	  seventy-five and eighty, inclusive.</li>
	<li> Approximate the probability of part (a).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> Fifty-five percent of the registered voters in Mount Pleasant
      favor their incumbent mayor in her bid for re-election. If four
      hundred voters go to the polls, estimate the probability that
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> the race ends in a tie.</li>
	<li> the challenger scores an upset victory.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> A bank teller serves customers standing in line one by
      one. Suppose that the service time for a customer has mean 2
      (minutes) and variance 0.6, and assume that service times for
      different bank customers are independent.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find the probability that the time required to serve 50
	  customers is between 92 and 108 minutes.</li>
	<li> The bank wants to find a time interval \((100-x,100+x)\)
	  for which there is a \(0.85\) probability that the teller
	  can serve 50 customers. Find \(x\).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
  </ol>
