  <h2>Homework 22: Hypergeometric and Geometric Distributions</h2>

  <ol>

    <li> To demonstrate his benevolence, Darth Vader decides to use
      the Death Star to randomly destroy six of the twelve planets of
      the Dagobah system (rather than all twelve, as suggested by the
      Emperor). Four of the twelve planets harbor life.

      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find the probability that at least three of the four
	  planets harboring life are destroyed.</li>

	<li> Find the expected number of planets harboring life that
	  will be destroyed.</li>

      </ol>

      For both parts, you should ignore the fact that Yoda lives in
      the Dagobah system.</li>

    <li> Because of his past convictions for fraud, Greeedo has a 20%
      chance each year of having his tax returns audited. What is the
      probability that he will not be audited for the next three
      years?
    </li>

    <li> Mad Max is applying for a driver's license.  Assume that his
      probability of passing the driving test on any attempt is
      \(0.20\). Let \(X\) be the number of tries that he needs in
      order to pass the driving test.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	
	<li>  Find \(f_X(x)\) and \(E(X)\).</li>

	<li> Find \(y\) such that the probability of Max not passing
	the test after taking it \(y\) times is under 5%.</li>
	
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li> Country A launches ten missiles at country B. Six of the ten
      are armed with nuclear warheads. To intercept the missiles,
      country B launches seven antiballistic missiles, each of which
      will destroy exactly one of the incoming rockets. The
      antiballistic missiles are unable to detect which of the ten
      rockets are carrying nuclear warheads.
      
      <ol class="nested-list">

	<li> Find the probability that country B will be hit by at
	  least two nuclear missiles.</li>

	<li> Find the expected number of nuclear missiles that will
	  hit country B.</li>

      </ol>
