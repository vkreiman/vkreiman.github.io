  <h2>Homework 18: Indicator Random Variables</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> You randomly throw 6 balls into 10 different baskets. Let
      \(X\) be the number of balls which land in the first basket, and
      let \(Y\) be the number of baskets which are empty.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find \(f_X(x)\).</li>
	<li> Find \(E(X)\).</li>
	<li> Find \(E(Y)\). (Hint. Let \(I_j\) be the indicator of the
	  event ``basket \(j\) is empty''. Note that \(Y\) is the sum
	  of the \(I_j\)'s.)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li> From a group of 8 math majors and 7 physics majors (no double
      majors), 4 are randomly selected for the Putnam Competition
      team. Let \(M\) be the number of math majors on the team. Find
      \(E(M)\) in two ways:
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Use the definition of \(E(M)\). (You will need to first
	  find \(f_M(m)\).)</li>
	<li> Use indicator random variables. Specifically, let \(I_j\)
	  be the indicator of the event ``the \(j\)-th person selected
	  is a math major''. Use the fact that
	  \(M=I_1+I_2+I_3+I_4\).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    
    <li> Ten husband and wife couples are randomly seated in a
      circle. Find the expected number of husbands who are seated next
      to their wives.
    </li>
    
    <li> Suppose a bent coin has a probability \(p=0.4\) of landing
      heads. If one flips the coin \(n\) times, what is the expected
      number of heads which are immediately followed by a tail. (For
      example, if \(n=8\), then for outcome 'THHTTHTH', two heads,
      namely the third and sixth flips, are immediately followed by a
      tail.)
    </li>

    
    <li> A population of \(n\) people vote in an election. \(d\) vote
      democratic and \(n-d\) vote republican. In the next election,
      the probability of a democratic voter switching to republican is
      \(p_1\), and the probability of a republican voter switching to
      democratic is \(p_2\). Let \(X\) be the number of democratic
      votes in the second election. Find \(E(X)\).
    </li>
