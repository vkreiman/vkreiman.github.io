  <h2>Homework 11: Jointly Distributed Discrete Random Variables</h2>

  <ol>

    <li> Section 3.2, #7, Section 3.3, #8, 9.</li>

    <li>
    Section 3.4, #2(a)(c)(d)(e), Section 3.5, #2(a).</li>

    <li> Four cards are drawn from a deck. Let \(X\) be the number of
      kings drawn and \(Y\) the number of queens.
      <ol class="nested-list">
	<li> Find \(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\).</li>
	<li> Use part (a) to find the probability that exactly 2 kings
	are drawn.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li> Two dice are tossed. Let \(X\) be the number of 2's that
      appear and \(Y\) the number of 3's. Write the matrix giving
      \(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\). Define a third random variable \(Z\) by
      \(Z=X+Y\). Use \(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\) to find \(f_Z(z)\).</li>
