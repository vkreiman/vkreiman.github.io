    <h2>Homework 1: The Definition of a Topology</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions. Assignments should be <b>stapled</b> and
    written clearly and legibly.

    <ol>
      <li>Section 1.1, #1.3, 1.5, 1.7. </li>
      
      <li>Suppose that \(\ct_1\) and \(\ct_2\) are two topologies on a
	set \(X\). Prove that \(\ct_1\cap \ct_2\) is a topology on
	\(X\), but \(\ct_1\cup \ct_2\) need not be a topology on \(X\).
