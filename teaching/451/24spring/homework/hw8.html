    <ol>
      <li> Let \(X\) be a nonempty set. A relation \(R\) on \(X\) is
	said to be <b>circular</b> if, for all \(x,y,z\in X\),
	\(x\,R\,y\) and \(y\,R\,z\) implies \(z\,R\, x\). Prove that a
	relation \(R\) on \(X\) is an equivalence relation if and only
	if \(R\) is reflexive and circular.</li>

      <li> Let \(X\) be the set of directed line segments \(PQ\) (with
	initial point \(P\) and terminal point \(Q\)) in
	\(\bR^2\). Give an equivalence relation \(\sim\) for which
	\(X/\sim\) is the usual set of vectors in \(\bR^2\).</li>

      <li> Consider \(\bR\) with relation \(Q = \{(x,y)\in \bR\times
	\bR: x-y\in \bZ\}\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Verify that \(Q\) is an equivalence relation.</li>
	  <li> Find the equivalence classes.</li>
	  <li> Identify \(\bR/Q\) with an interval in \(\bR\).</li>
	  <li> Identify \(\bR/Q\) with \(S^1\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Consider \(\bR^2\) with relation \((a,b)\sim (c,d)\) if
	\(a+2d=c+2b\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Verify that \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation.</li>
	  <li> What are the equivalence classes?</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Let \(X=\{(a,b)\in \bZ\times \bZ\mid b\neq 0\}\).  Define
	relation \(\sim\) on \(X\) by \((a,b)\sim (c,d)\) if \(ad=bc\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Verify that \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation.</li>
	  <li> Give three elements in \([(1,2)]\).</li>
	  <li> \(X/\sim\) is sometimes used to define a set with which you
	    are familiar. Give the set.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> (Number Theory) Consider \(\bZ\) with relation \(a\sim b\) if
	\(5\mid a-b\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Verify that \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation.</li>
	  <li> Find the equivalence classes.</li>
	  <li> What is the cardinality of \(\bZ/\sim\)?</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <li> (Linear Algebra) Let \(V\) be a vector space and \(W\) a
	subspace. Consider the relation \(\sim\) on \(V\) defined by
	\(\bu \sim \bv\) if \(\bu - \bv\in W\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Verify that \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation. The
	    corresponding quotient \(V/\sim\) is usually denoted by
	    \(V/W\).</li>
	  <li> Let \(V=\bR^2\) and \(W=\) Span\(\vtwo{1}{1}\), a
	    subspace of \(V\). What are the equivalence classes? What
	    is \(V/W\)?</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
