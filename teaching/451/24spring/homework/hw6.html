    <h2>Homework 6: Boundary of a Set, Subspace Topology</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions. Assignments should be <b>stapled</b> and
	written clearly and legibly.
      </i>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Section 2.3, #2.24(f), 2.26(a)(c), 2.28(a).</li>

      <li> Section 3.1, #3.4, 3.7, 3.11(b). Note that the latter two
	problems require proofs.</li>

      <li> Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(A\subseteq X\). Prove that
	\(\partial A=\emptyset\) if and only if \(A\) is both open and
	closed.</li>

      <li> True or False: If \(U\) is open, then \(U=
	\operatorname{Int}(\ol{U})\). Answer True or False, then
	justify your answer.</li>
