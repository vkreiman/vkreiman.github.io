    <h2>Homework 9: Quotient Topology</h2>


    <p><i>Instructions. Assignments should be stapled and
	written clearly and legibly.
      </i>
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li> Section 3.3, #3.23, 3.24, 3.27, 3.33(a)(b)(c)(h)(j)(k)</li>

      <li> Let \(X\) and \(S\) be sets, and let \(g:X\to S\) be a
	surjective map. Define a relation \(\sim\) on \(X\) by \(x\sim y\) if
	\(g(x)=g(y)\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Verify that \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation.</li>
	  <li> What are the equivalence classes of \(\sim\)?</li>
	  <li> Prove that there exists a bijection
	    \(\overline{g}:(X/\sim)\to S\) such that the following
	    diagram commutes: <br> <br> <br>


	    
	    
	    where \(\pi\) is
	    the standard projection. By the diagram commuting, we mean
	    that \(g= \overline{g}\circ \pi\). Another way of saying
	    this is that the map \(g\) <i>factors</i> as the
	    composition of the two maps \(\overline{g}\) and \(\pi\);
	    we sometimes describe this by saying that \(g\) <i>factors
	    through \(X/ \sim\)</i>.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      
      <li> Let \(X\) be a topological space, \(S\) a set, and \(g:X\to
	S\) a surjective map. Give \(S\) the quotient topology. Let
	\(C\) be a subset of \(S\).  Prove that \(C\) is closed in
	\(S\) if and only if \(g^{-1}(C)\) is closed in \(X\).
