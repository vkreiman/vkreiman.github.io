    <h2>Homework 15: Components and Total Disconnectedness</h2>
    
    <ol>

      <li> Let \(X\) be a topological space. Suppose that \(A\) is an
	open and closed subset of \(X\). Prove that \(A\) is the union
	of components of \(X\).</li>

      <li> In this problem we prove that \(\bR\) is not homeomorphic
      to \(\bR_l\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Give all continuous functions \(f:\bR\to \bR_l\). Prove
	    your answer.  (Hint: Consider the components of \(\bR\)
	    and \(\bR_l\).)
	  </li>

	  <li> Use (a) to prove \(\bR\not\cong \bR_l\).
	  </li>
	  
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Let \(X\) be a topological space. Define an equivalence
	relation on \(X\) by \(x\sim y\) if there exists a connected
	subset of \(X\) containing both \(x\) and \(y\). In class we
	verified that \(\sim\) is an equivalence relation and defined
	the components of \(X\) to be the equivalence classes. Prove
	that \(X/ \sim\) with quotient topology is totally
	disconnected.
      </li>
      
      <li> Prove that the complement of a dense open subset of
	\([0,1]\) is totally disconnected.
      </li>
      
      <li> Give an explicit homeomorphism \(f:\mathring{B}^2\to
	\bR^2\), and give its inverse function explicitly (see top of
	page 17 for the definition of \(\mathring{B}^2\)). You need
	not prove that \(f\) or its inverse function are continuous.
	However, you must explain why both \(f\) and its inverse
	function are well defined, and verify that they are inverse to
	eachother.  This problem shows that ``boundedness'' is not a
	topological property.
