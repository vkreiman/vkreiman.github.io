    <h2>Homework 17: Compactness</h2>
    
    <ol>

      <li> Section 7.1, #7.8, 7.9, 7.13(a).</li>

      <li> Prove that \(X\) is compact if and only if the following
	condition holds: For every collection \(\cC\) of closed sets
	in \(X\) whose itersection is empty, there exists a finite
	subcollection of \(\cC\) whose intersection is empty.<br>

	<i> Note: You may find it helpful to solve this problem
	before solving the textbook problems above.</i>
