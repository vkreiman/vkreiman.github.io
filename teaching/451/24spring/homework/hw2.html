    <h2>Homework 2: Basis for a Topology</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions. Assignments should be <b>stapled</b> and
    written clearly and legibly.
      </i>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Section 1.1, #1.4.</li>

      <li>Section 1.2, #1.11(a), (b).</li>
      
      <li>
	Let \(\cb\)and \(\cb'\) be two bases on a set \(X\), and let
	\(\ct_{\cb}\) and \(\ct_{\cb'}\) be the corresponding
	topologies generated by the bases. Consider the following two
	statements:<br>

	(i) <i>For every \(B'\in \cb'\) and \(x\in B'\), there
	exists \(B\in \cb\) such that \(x\in B\subseteq B'\)</i>.
	
	(ii) <i>For every \(B\in \cb\) and \(x\in B\), there exists
	\(B'\in \cb'\) such that \(x\in B'\subseteq B\)}.</i>

	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li>Prove that \(\ct_{\cb}\) is
	    finer than \(\ct_{\cb'}\) if and only if (i) holds.</li>
	  <li>
	    Prove that \(\ct_{\cb}=\ct_{\cb'}\) if and only if (i) and
	    (ii) both hold. (Hint: use part (a).)</li>
	  
	  <li> Use the Union
	    Lemma to express (i) in terms of unions.</li>
