      <li> (Linear Algebra) In this problem you will prove that the
	Euclidean metric \(d\) on \(\bR^n\) is a metric. For
	\(\bx,\by\in \bR^n\) and \(c\in \bR\), define \(\bx+\by\),
	\(c\bx\), and \(\bx\cdot \by\) to be the standard vector
	addition, scalar multiplication, and dot product respectively.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(\bx\cdot (\by+\bz) = (\bx\cdot
	    \by)+(\bx\cdot \bz)\).</li>
	  <li> Prove the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality: \(|\bx\cdot
	    \by|\leq \|\bx\|\|\by\|\).

	    Hint: If \(\bx,\by\neq\bzer\), let \(a=1/\|\bx\|\) and
	    \(b=1/\|\by\|\), and use the fact that \(\|a\bx\pm
	    b\by\|^2\geq 0\).
	  </li>
	  <li> Prove that \(\|\bx+\by\| \leq \|\bx\| + \|\by\|\).
	    
	    Hint: Compute \(\|\bx+\by\|^2\) and apply (b).
	  </li>
	  <li> Verify that \(d\) is a metric.</li>
