    <h2>Homework 5: Limit Points</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions. Assignments should be <b>stapled</b> and
	written clearly and legibly.
      </i>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Section 2.2, #2.13(a)(c)(e)(f), 2.15.</li>
      
      <li> Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(A\subseteq X\).

	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li>Prove: if a sequence \((x_1,x_2,\ldots)\) of points
	    in \(A\) converges to \(x\), then \(x\in \overline{A}\).</li>

	  <li> Prove: if a sequence \((x_1,x_2,\ldots)\) of points
	    in \(A\setminus\{x\}\) converges to \(x\), then \(x\in
	    A'\).</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

  
      <li> A topological space \(X\) is said to be a \(T_1\)-space if
	finite subsets of \(X\) are closed.  Prove that a Hausdorff
	space is a \(T_1\)-space.<br>

	<i> Hint. Use a theorem we proved in class about Hausdorff
	  spaces.</i>
      </li>
  
      <li> Suppose that a topological space \(X\) is a \(T_1\)-space. Let
	\(A\subseteq X\).
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(x\) is a limit point of \(A\) if and only
	    if every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \(A\) in
	    infinitely many points.</li>
	  <li> Prove that \((A')'\subseteq A'\). </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
