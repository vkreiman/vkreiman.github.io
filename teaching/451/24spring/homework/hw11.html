      <li> Section 4.1, #4.9, 4.10, 4.12, 4.13(a), 4.14.</li>

      <li>
	Let \(f,g:X\to \bR\) be continuous, where \(\bR\) is given the
	standard topology.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that \(\{x:f(x)\leq g(x)\}\) is closed in
	    \(X\).</li>
     	  <li> Let \(h:X\to\bR\) be the function
	    \(h(x)=\min\{f(x),g(x)\}\). Prove that \(h\) is
	    continuous. (Hint: use the pasting lemma.) </li>
