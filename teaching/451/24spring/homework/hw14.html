    <h2>Homework 14: Connectedness</h2>
    
    <ol>
      
      <li> Section 6.1, #6.5, 6.8.

      <li> In this problem we examine Theorem 6.6 from the textbook.
	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that a topological space \(Z\) is connected if
	    and only if there does not exist a continuous, surjective
	    map \(f:Z\to \{0,1\}\), where \(\{0,1\}\) is given the
	    discrete topology.</li>

	  <li> Use (a) to give a new proof of Theorem 6.6.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li> Let \(A\) be a subset of a topological space \(X\). Suppose
	that \(D\subseteq X\) is connected and intersects both \(A\)
	and \(A^c\). Prove that \(D\) intersects \(\partial A\).<br>

	Hint: Recall that \(X=A^{\circ}\ \dot{\cup}\ \partial A\
	\dot{\cup}\ (A^c)^{\circ}\) (the disjoint union of the three
	sets).
      </li>
      
      <li> (Real Analysis) Let \(X\) denote the subset of
	\(\bR^{\infty}\) consisting of sequences
	\(\bx=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots)\) such that \(\sum x_i^2\)
	converges. You may use without proof any standard facts about
	infinite series.

	<ol class="nested-list">
	  <li> Prove that if \(\bx, \by\in X\), then \(\sum |x_iy_i|\)
	    converges.
	    (Hint: Use Problem 4(b) from Homework 13 to show that the
	    partial sums are bounded.)</li>

	  <li> Let \(c\in \bR\). Prove that if \(\bx, \by \in X\),
	    then \(\bx+\by, c\bx\in X\).</li>

	  <li> Prove that $$
	    d(\bx,\by)=\left[\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(x_i-y_i)^2\right]^{1/2}
	    $$ is a well-defined metric on \(X\). It is called the
	    \(\ell^2\) metric.
