    <h2>Homework 7: Product Topology</h2>

    <p><i>Instructions. Assignments should be stapled and
	written clearly and legibly.
      </i>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Section 3.2, #3.15, 3.16, 3.19, 3.21. Note the problems 3.15
	and 3.19 require proofs.</li>

      <li> Let \(X\) be a topological space. Define the
	<b>diagonal</b> of \(X\) to be \(\Delta=\{(x,x): x\in X\}\), a
	subset of \(X\times X\). Prove that \(X\) is Hausdorff if and
	only if \(\Delta\) is closed in \(X\times X\).</li>
