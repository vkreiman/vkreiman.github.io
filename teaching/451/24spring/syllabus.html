  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Introduction to the theory of
  topological spaces, metric spaces, continuous functions,
  connectedness, and compactness. Time permitting, we will discuss
  other topics such as homotopy or fixed-point theorems.  We will
  cover most of Chapters 1 - 7 of the textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> You will have to spend a substantial amount of
  time outside of class reading, thinking, and solving problems.
  Homework problems will require writing rigorous proofs.
  Approximately 17 homework assignments will be collected. Selected
  problems will be graded.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Collaboration</b><br /> Although you are permitted to discuss
  homework problems with other students, you should try to solve them
  by yourself first. Moreover, your write-ups must be your own. This
  means, specifically, that when you write your solutions or proofs,
  (i) you may not look at anyone else's, and (ii) you may not copy or
  paraphrase material from any source other than lecture notes or our
  textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on two one-hour exams
  (25% each), homework (25%), and a comprehensive final exam
  (25%).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br />
  Late homeworks will not be accepted.
