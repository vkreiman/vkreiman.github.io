  <b>Supplemental Instruction (SI)</b><br /> Supplemental Instruction
  is a university supported program which supplements the regular
  lectures. Each week there will be two one-hour study sessions in
  which you will review and discuss concepts and problems. You are not
  required to attend the SI sessions.

  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Introduction to linear algebra
  including systems of equations, matrices, determinants, vector
  spaces and linear transformations, diagonalization, orthogonality
  and least squares. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The only way to learn this subject is to spend
  a substantial amount of time thinking about it. This is one purpose
  of the homework assignments. To a greater extent than in 200 level
  courses, you will be required to solve homework problems which are
  not worked out in lecture or in the textbook.  Approximately 18
  homework assignments will be collected. Selected problems will be
  graded.  Please feel free to ask me in office hours or before,
  during, or after class any questions you may have about the problems
  or the course in general.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on homework and one
  quiz (8%), two in-class exams (30% each), and a comprehensive final
  exam (32%).  The final exam will be from 5:45 pm - 7:45 pm,
  Wednesday, December 13, 2023.
</p>


<p>
  <b>Collaboration</b><br /> Although you are permitted to discuss
  homework problems with other students, you should try to solve them
  by yourself first. Moreover, your write-ups must be your own. This
  means, specifically, that when you write your solutions or proofs,
  (i) you may not look at anyone else's, and (ii) you may not copy or
  paraphrase material from any source other than lecture notes or our
  textbook.

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> Late homeworks will not be accepted.
