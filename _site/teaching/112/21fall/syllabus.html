<p>
  <b>Meeting Times and Place</b><br /> MTuWF 10:00 - 10:53 am, MOLN
  L222.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Prerequisites</b><br /> Math 111 with a grade of C or better; or
  equivalent; or appropriate placement score.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Required Textbook</b><br />
  Stewart, <i>Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus</i>, seventh edition.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Topics include functions and
  graphs, polynomial functions, exponential and logarithmic
  functions, sequences, series, and combinatorics. We will cover
  parts of chapters 1 - 4, 10, and 12 from the textbook. </p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned in class; most
  will be taken from the textbook. You may discuss homework problems
  with other students, but I recommend that you first try to solve
  them on your own.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, three
  in-class exams, and periodic quizzes. The final exam will be given
  on Saturday December 11, 1:00 - 3:00 pm. Each of the in-class exams
  will be announced in class at least one week before it is given.The
  final grade will be calculated using the following weights: quizzes
  20%; in-class exams 20% each; final exam 20%. Your two lowest quiz
  scores will be dropped. The following grading scale will be applied:
  94 - 100 A, 90 - 93 A-, 88 - 89 B+, 84 - 87 B, 80 - 83 B-, 78 - 79
  C+, 74 - 77 C, 70 - 73 C-, 64 - 69 D, 60 - 63 D-, 0 - 59 F.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> In-class exams may be made up in the
  event of documented illness.  If you miss an exam, you need to
  inform me before the time of the exam. Exams must be made up
  within one day of the original exam date. There are no makeup
  quizzes.</p>

<p>
  <b> Studying</b><br /> A general rule for this course is for
  every 1 hour spent in a class you should spend 1 to 3 hours
  outside of class studying.  If it is a difficult class for
  you, you may need to spend more time than this.  In math
  people often think: I did the homework; that's all the
  studying I need to do.  Reading your notes and reviewing your
  homework, quizzes, and exams are also excellent ways to help
  you succeed in this course.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Calculators</b><br /> A calculator with logarithmic functions
  will be required for at least one quiz in chapter
  4. Calculators are not allowed on the other exams and
  quizzes. Cell phones, tablets, and laptops are not acceptable
  forms of a calculator.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Help</b><br /> Free tutoring is available to all students at
  Wyllie D180 (262-595-2044, tutoring.center@uwp.edu) and at NetTutor
  (<a href="https://www.uwp.edu/learn/academicsupport/parc/nettutor.cfm">
  https://www.uwp.edu/learn/academicsupport/parc/nettutor.cfm</a>).  I
  also encourage you to see or email me if you have any questions.
</p>


<p>
  <b>Academic Accommodation</b><br /> It is the policy and practice of
  UW - Parkside to create inclusive work environments. If there are
  aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
  barriers to your inclusion, please notify me as soon as
  possible. You are also welcome to contact Student Accessibility
  Services, telephone 262-595-2372, or email Dr. Renee Sartin Kirby at
  kirby@uwp.edu. For more information, visit the Student Accessibility
  Services website
  at <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/live/offices/accessibilityservices/">
  https://www.uwp.edu/live/offices/accessibilityservices/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Safe Learning Environment</b><br /> UW-Parkside is committed to
  fostering a safe, productive learning and working environment for
  all students, faculty, and staff. Title IX of the Education
  Amendment Act of 1972 states that “no person in the United States
  shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
  education program or activity receiving federal financial
  assistance”. Title IX covers forms of sexual misconduct, including
  sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, stalking,
  dating/relationship violence, and sexual assault. As these matters
  can have a significant impact on your life as a student, both in and
  out of the classroom, UW-Parkside provides a variety of resources
  and reporting options, which you can find by going to the following
  link: <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/">
  https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Electronic Devices</b><br /> The use of cell phones, smart
  phones, or other mobile communication devices is disruptive,
  and is therefore prohibited during class. Except in
  emergencies, those using such devices must leave the classroom
  for the remainder of the class period. The use of computers,
  including tablets and laptops, is prohibited in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Recordings and Live-Streamings</b><br /> Please note that at the
  instructor’s discretion, lectures and class sessions may be live
  streamed and/or recorded and made available to students registered
  for the class. The use of live streaming and lecture capture is
  intended to supplement the classroom experience solely for the
  benefit of students registered in the class. UW-Parkside prohibits
  faculty, staff and students from copying, distributing, or using
  lecture capture recordings for any other purpose; violation of this
  prohibition may be grounds for UW-Parkside to initiate disciplinary
  proceedings.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Disclaimer</b><br /> The course syllabus is a general plan for
  the course; deviations announced in class may be necessary.
