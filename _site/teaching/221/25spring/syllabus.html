<p>
  <b>Meeting Times and Place</b><br /> MTuWThF 10:00 - 10:53 AM, MOLN
  L161.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Prerequisites</b><br /> Math 112 and 113 or equivalent; or
  placement.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Textbook</b><br /> Stewart, <i>Calculus</i>, 8th edition (2012),
  Cengage.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> Introductory differential and
  integral calculus and applications. Topics include rate of change
  and limits, continuity, differentiation, applications of the
  derivative, integration, applications of the integral, and
  transcendental functions. We will cover most of chapters 1 - 6 from
  the textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned in class; most
  will be taken from the textbook. Assignments will be collected
  daily. You may discuss homework problems with other students, but I
  recommend that you first try to solve them on your own.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, three
  in-class exams, periodic quizzes, and homework. The final exam will
  be on Saturday May 10 from 1:00 - 3:00 PM. Each of the in-class exams
  will be announced in class at least one week before it is given.The
  final grade will be calculated using the following weights: homework
  10%; quizzes 16%; in-class exams 18% each; final exam 20%. Your
  lowest two quiz scores will be dropped. The following grading scale
  will be applied: 90 - 100 A, 80 - 89 B, 70 - 79 C, 60 - 69 D, 0 - 59
  F.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> In-class exams may be made up in the event
  of documented illness.  If you miss an exam, you need to inform me
  before the time of the exam. Exams must be made up within one day of
  the original exam date. There are no makeup quizzes.
</p>

<p>
  <b> Studying</b><br /> A general rule for this course is for every 1
  hour spent in a class you should spend 1 to 3 hours outside of class
  studying.  If it is a difficult class for you, you may need to spend
  more time than this.  Reading your notes and reviewing your
  homework, quizzes, and exams are also excellent ways to help you
  succeed in this course.
</p>

<p><b>Calculators</b><br /> Calculators are not allowed on exams or
  quizzes and are not required for the course.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Help</b><br /> I encourage you to see or email me if you have any
  questions.  Free tutoring is available to all students at Wyllie
  D180 (262-595-2044, tutoring.center@uwp.edu) and at NetTutor
  (<a href="https://www.uwp.edu/learn/academicsupport/parc/nettutor.cfm">https://www.uwp.edu/learn/academicsupport/parc/nettutor.cfm</a>).
</p>


<p>
  <b>Academic Accommodation</b><br /> It is the policy and practice of
  UW - Parkside to create inclusive work environments. If there are
  aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
  barriers to your inclusion, please notify me as soon as
  possible. You are also welcome to contact Student Accessibility
  Services, telephone 262-595-2372, or email Dr. Renee Sartin Kirby at
  kirby@uwp.edu. For more information, visit the Student Accessibility
  Services website

</p>

<p>
  <b>Safe Learning Environment</b><br /> UW-Parkside is committed to
  fostering a safe, productive learning and working environment for
  all students, faculty, and staff. Title IX of the Education
  Amendment Act of 1972 states that “no person in the United States
  shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
  education program or activity receiving federal financial
  assistance”. Title IX covers forms of sexual misconduct, including
  sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, stalking,
  dating/relationship violence, and sexual assault. As these matters
  can have a significant impact on your life as a student, both in and
  out of the classroom, UW-Parkside provides a variety of resources
  and reporting options, which you can find by going to the following
  link: <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/">
  https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Electronic Devices</b><br /> The use of cell phones, smart
  phones, or other mobile communication devices is disruptive,
  and is therefore prohibited during class. Except in
  emergencies, those using such devices must leave the classroom
  for the remainder of the class period. The use of computers,
  including tablets and laptops, is prohibited in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Recordings and Live-Streamings</b><br /> Please note that at the
  instructor’s discretion, lectures and class sessions may be live
  streamed and/or recorded and made available to students registered
  for the class. The use of live streaming and lecture capture is
  intended to supplement the classroom experience solely for the
  benefit of students registered in the class. UW-Parkside prohibits
  faculty, staff and students from copying, distributing, or using
  lecture capture recordings for any other purpose; violation of this
  prohibition may be grounds for UW-Parkside to initiate disciplinary
  proceedings.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Disclaimer</b><br /> The course syllabus is a general plan for
  the course; deviations announced in class may be necessary.
