<p><b>Meeting Place and Times</b><br /> Synchronous online, 9:00 -
  9:53 am M - F</p>

<p><b>Textbook</b><br />
  Stewart, <i>Calculus</i>, 8th edition (2012), Cengage</p>

<p><b>Online Lectures</b><br /> Live lectures will be delivered
  virtually during class times. To attend these lectures, login to
  Canvas, then go to Collaborate Ultra. Every lecture will also be
  recorded and will be available for viewing approximately one hour
  after the time of the live lecture.</p>

<p><b>Online Quizzes and Exams</b><br /> During the appropriate quiz
  or exam time, you should download the quiz or exam from Canvas, and
  then write down your solutions on paper. Then, either take pictures
  of your solutions on your phone or scan them onto a computer, and
  upload back to Canvas. Your upload will have to be in pdf
  format. (The app Adobe Scan allows you to convert pictures on your
  phone to pdf format.) There will be a practice quiz on Wednesday
  February 3, in order for you to practice this procedure.
</p>
  
<p><b>Course Description</b><br /> Introductory differential and
  integral calculus and applications. Topics include rate of change
  and limits, continuity, differentiation, applications of the
  derivative, integration, applications of the integral, and
  transcendental functions. We will cover most of chapters 1 - 6 from
  the textbook.</p>

<p><b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned in class; most
  will be taken from the textbook. You may certainly discuss homework
  problems with others, but I recommend that you first try to solve
  them on your own.</p>

<p><b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, three
  in-class exams, and periodic quizzes. The final exam will be on
  Saturday May 8, 1 - 3 pm. Each of the in-class exams will be
  announced in class at least one week before it is given.The final
  grade will be calculated using the following weights: quizzes 20%;
  in-class exams 20% each; final exam 20%. Your lowest two quiz scores
  will be dropped. The following grading scale will be applied: 90 -
  100 A, 80 - 89 B, 70 - 79 C, 60 - 69 D, 0 - 59 F.</p>

<p><b>Missed work</b><br />
  In-class exams and quizzes may be made up in the event of documented
  illness.</p>

<p><b>Calculators</b><br />
  Calculators are not allowed on exams or quizzes and not
  required for the course.</p>

<p><b>Help</b><br /> You can always see me if you have any
  questions.  Free tutoring is available to all students at Wyllie
  D180 (262-595-2044, tutoring.center@uwp.edu).</p>
