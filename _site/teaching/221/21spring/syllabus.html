<p><b>Meeting Place and Times</b><br /> Synchronous online, 9:00 -
  9:53 am M - F</p>

<p><b>Office Hours</b><br /> After class or by appointment</p>


<p><b>Textbook</b><br />
  Stewart, <i>Calculus</i>, 8th edition (2012), Cengage</p>

<p><b>Online Lectures</b><br /> Synchronous lectures will be delivered
  virtually during class times. To attend these lectures, login to
  Canvas, then go to Collaborate Ultra. Every lecture will also be
  recorded and will be available for viewing after the synchronous
  lecture.</p>

<p><b>Online Quizzes and Exams</b><br /> During the appropriate quiz
  or exam time, you should download the quiz or exam from Canvas, and
  then write down your solutions on paper. After you have finished,
  either take pictures of your solutions on your phone or scan them
  onto a computer, and then upload back to Canvas. Your upload will
  have to be in pdf format. (The app Adobe Scan allows you to convert
  pictures on your phone to pdf format.) There will be a practice quiz
  on Wednesday February 3, in order for you to practice this
  procedure.
</p>
  
<p><b>Course Description</b><br /> Introductory differential and
  integral calculus and applications. Topics include rate of change
  and limits, continuity, differentiation, applications of the
  derivative, integration, applications of the integral, and
  transcendental functions. We will cover most of chapters 1 - 6 from
  the textbook.</p>

<p><b>Homework</b><br /> The way to learn mathematics is to first try
  to understand the concepts, and then apply your understanding to
  solve problems.  Homework problems will be assigned in class; most
  will be taken from the textbook. You may certainly discuss homework
  problems with others, but I recommend that you first try to solve
  them on your own.</p>

<p><b>Grading</b><br /> Graded work will include a final exam, three
  in-class exams, and periodic quizzes. The final exam will be on
  Saturday May 8, 1 - 3 pm. Each of the in-class exams will be
  announced in class at least one week before it is given.The final
  grade will be calculated using the following weights: quizzes 20%;
  in-class exams 20% each; final exam 20%. Your lowest two quiz scores
  will be dropped. The following grading scale will be applied: 90 -
  100 A, 80 - 89 B, 70 - 79 C, 60 - 69 D, 0 - 59 F.</p>

<p><b>Missed work</b><br />
  In-class exams and quizzes may be made up in the event of documented
  illness.</p>

<p><b>Calculators</b><br />
  Calculators are not allowed on exams or quizzes and not
  required for the course.</p>

<p><b>Help</b><br /> You can always see me if you have any
  questions.  Free tutoring is available to all students at Wyllie
  D180 (262-595-2044, tutoring.center@uwp.edu).</p>









<p>
  <b>Academic Accommodation</b><br /> It is the policy and practice of
  UW - Parkside to create inclusive work environments. If there are
  aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
  barriers to your inclusion, please notify me as soon as
  possible. You are also welcome to contact Student Accessibility
  Services, telephone 262-595-2372, or email Dr. Renee Sartin Kirby at
  kirby@uwp.edu. For more information, visit the Student Accessibility
  Services website

</p>

<p>
  <b>Safe Learning Environment</b><br /> UW-Parkside is committed to
  fostering a safe, productive learning and working environment for
  all students, faculty, and staff. Title IX of the Education
  Amendment Act of 1972 states that “no person in the United States
  shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
  education program or activity receiving federal financial
  assistance”. Title IX covers forms of sexual misconduct, including
  sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, stalking,
  dating/relationship violence, and sexual assault. As these matters
  can have a significant impact on your life as a student, both in and
  out of the classroom, UW-Parkside provides a variety of resources
  and reporting options, which you can find by going to the following
  link: <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/">
  https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Electronic Devices</b><br /> The use of cell phones, smart
  phones, or other mobile communication devices is disruptive,
  and is therefore prohibited during class. Except in
  emergencies, those using such devices must leave the classroom
  for the remainder of the class period. The use of computers,
  including tablets and laptops, is prohibited in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Recordings and Live-Streamings</b><br /> Please note that at the
  instructor’s discretion, lectures and class sessions may be live
  streamed and/or recorded and made available to students registered
  for the class. The use of live streaming and lecture capture is
  intended to supplement the classroom experience solely for the
  benefit of students registered in the class. UW-Parkside prohibits
  faculty, staff and students from copying, distributing, or using
  lecture capture recordings for any other purpose; violation of this
  prohibition may be grounds for UW-Parkside to initiate disciplinary
  proceedings.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Disclaimer</b><br /> The course syllabus is a general plan for
  the course; deviations announced in class may be necessary.
