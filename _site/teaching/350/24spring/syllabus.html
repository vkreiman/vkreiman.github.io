<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> In this course we study the
  theoretical framework of calculus, including the fundamental
  properties of real numbers, sequences, series, limits, continuity,
  uniform continuity, topology of the real numbers and metric spaces,
  compactness, derivatives, and integrals.  We will cover most of
  Chapters 3 - 8 of the textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> You will have to spend a substantial amount of
  time outside of class reading, thinking, and solving problems.
  Homework problems will require writing rigorous
  proofs. Approximately 15 homework assignments will be
  collected. Selected problems will be graded.  Please feel free to
  ask me in office hours or before, during, or after class any
  questions you may have about the problems or the course in general.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Collaboration</b><br /> Although you are permitted to discuss
  homework problems with other students, you should try to solve them
  by yourself first. Moreover, your write-ups must be your own. This
  means, specifically, that when you write your solutions or proofs,
  (i) you may not look at anyone else's, and (ii) you may not copy or
  paraphrase material from any source other than lecture notes or our
  textbook.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on two one-hour exams
  (30% each), homework (10%), and a comprehensive final exam
  (30%). The final exam will be from 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM, Friday May 10,
  2024.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Missed work</b><br /> Late homeworks will not be accepted.
</p>



<p>
  <b>Academic Accommodation</b><br /> It is the policy and practice of
  UW - Parkside to create inclusive work environments. If there are
  aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
  barriers to your inclusion, please notify me as soon as
  possible. You are also welcome to contact Student Accessibility
  Services, telephone 262-595-2372, or email Dr. Renee Sartin Kirby at
  kirby@uwp.edu. For more information, visit the Student Accessibility
  Services website

</p>

<p>
  <b>Safe Learning Environment</b><br /> UW-Parkside is committed to
  fostering a safe, productive learning and working environment for
  all students, faculty, and staff. Title IX of the Education
  Amendment Act of 1972 states that “no person in the United States
  shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
  education program or activity receiving federal financial
  assistance”. Title IX covers forms of sexual misconduct, including
  sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, stalking,
  dating/relationship violence, and sexual assault. As these matters
  can have a significant impact on your life as a student, both in and
  out of the classroom, UW-Parkside provides a variety of resources
  and reporting options, which you can find by going to the following
  link: <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/">
  https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Electronic Devices</b><br /> The use of cell phones, smart
  phones, or other mobile communication devices is disruptive,
  and is therefore prohibited during class. Except in
  emergencies, those using such devices must leave the classroom
  for the remainder of the class period. The use of computers,
  including tablets and laptops, is prohibited in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Recordings and Live-Streamings</b><br /> Please note that at the
  instructor’s discretion, lectures and class sessions may be live
  streamed and/or recorded and made available to students registered
  for the class. The use of live streaming and lecture capture is
  intended to supplement the classroom experience solely for the
  benefit of students registered in the class. UW-Parkside prohibits
  faculty, staff and students from copying, distributing, or using
  lecture capture recordings for any other purpose; violation of this
  prohibition may be grounds for UW-Parkside to initiate disciplinary
  proceedings.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Disclaimer</b><br /> The course syllabus is a general plan for
  the course; deviations announced in class may be necessary.
