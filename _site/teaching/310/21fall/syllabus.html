<p>
  <b>Meeting Times and Place</b><br /> MTuWF 1:00 - 1:53 pm, MOLN
  L222.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Prerequisites</b><br /> Math 223.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Textbook</b><br />
  Required:<br /> Degroot and
  Schervish, <i>Probability and Statistics</i>, 4th edition (2012),
  Pearson.<br />
  
  <br /> Supplemental Textbooks:<br /> Carol Ash, <i>The Probability
    Tutoring Book</i>, 1993, IEEE Press.<br /> Larsen and
  Marx, <i>Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its
    Applications</i>, 5th edition (2011), Pearson.<br /> Frederick
  Solomon, <i>Probability and Stochastic Processes</i>, Copyright
  1987, Prentice Hall.<br />
</p>

<p>
  <b>Course Description</b><br /> The main mathematical methods and
  techniques of probability theory; random variables, expected
  values, variance, central limit theorem. Time permitting, we
  will also cover topics in estimation and hypothesis testing.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Homework</b><br /> The only way to learn this subject is to spend
  a substantial amount of time thinking about it. This is one purpose
  of the homework assignments. To a greater extent than in 200 level
  courses, you will be required to solve homework problems which are
  not worked out in lecture or in the textbook. You may certainly
  discuss the problems with other students. However, I encourage you
  to first try to solve homework problems by yourself. Please feel
  free to ask me in office hours or before, during, or after class any
  questions you may have about the problems or the course in general.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b><br /> Your grade will be based on quizzes (25%), two
  in-class exams (25% each), and a comprehensive final exam (25%). The
  final exam will be from 1:00 - 3:00 pm, Friday December 17,
  2021. </p>

<p>
  <b>Calculators</b><br /> Calculators are not allowed on exams and
  not required for the course.
</p>








<p>
  <b>Academic Accommodation</b><br /> It is the policy and practice of
  UW - Parkside to create inclusive work environments. If there are
  aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
  barriers to your inclusion, please notify me as soon as
  possible. You are also welcome to contact Student Accessibility
  Services, telephone 262-595-2372, or email Dr. Renee Sartin Kirby at
  kirby@uwp.edu. For more information, visit the Student Accessibility
  Services website
  at <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/live/offices/accessibilityservices/">

</p>

<p>
  <b>Safe Learning Environment</b><br /> UW-Parkside is committed to
  fostering a safe, productive learning and working environment for
  all students, faculty, and staff. Title IX of the Education
  Amendment Act of 1972 states that “no person in the United States
  shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
  education program or activity receiving federal financial
  assistance”. Title IX covers forms of sexual misconduct, including
  sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, stalking,
  dating/relationship violence, and sexual assault. As these matters
  can have a significant impact on your life as a student, both in and
  out of the classroom, UW-Parkside provides a variety of resources
  and reporting options, which you can find by going to the following
  link: <a href="https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/">
  https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/titleix/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Electronic Devices</b><br /> The use of cell phones, smart
  phones, or other mobile communication devices is disruptive,
  and is therefore prohibited during class. Except in
  emergencies, those using such devices must leave the classroom
  for the remainder of the class period. The use of computers,
  including tablets and laptops, is prohibited in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Recordings and Live-Streamings</b><br /> Please note that at the
  instructor’s discretion, lectures and class sessions may be live
  streamed and/or recorded and made available to students registered
  for the class. The use of live streaming and lecture capture is
  intended to supplement the classroom experience solely for the
  benefit of students registered in the class. UW-Parkside prohibits
  faculty, staff and students from copying, distributing, or using
  lecture capture recordings for any other purpose; violation of this
  prohibition may be grounds for UW-Parkside to initiate disciplinary
  proceedings.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Disclaimer</b><br /> The course syllabus is a general plan for
  the course; deviations announced in class may be necessary.
